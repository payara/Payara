        Notes from Ron:
        The proprietary callback classes predate Glassfish v2. we
        maintained support for them in v2 and v3, where they are
        available for use by auth modules written to the proprietary spi
        (which we continue to support in v3).  We only made the
        proprietary spi available to parties within sun; including the
        opensso/then access manager team, and for the native ws-security
        auth-modules created by the xwss team for appserver 8.1.  The
        ws-secuity modules are being phased out in favor of the new
        wsit/ws-policy based auth modules, and the opensso modules should
        evolve to the standard spi.
