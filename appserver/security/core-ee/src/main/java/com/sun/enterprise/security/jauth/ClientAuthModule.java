 * This interface describes a module that can be configured for a ClientAuthContext. The main purpose of this module is

 * A module implementation must assume it may be used to issue different requests as different clients. It is the module
 * implementation's responsibility to properly store and restore any state as necessary. A module that does not need to
 * do so may remain completely stateless.
 *
 * <p>
 * Modules are passed a shared state Map that can be used to save state across a sequence of calls from
 * <code>secureRequest</code> to <code>validateResponse</code> to <code>disposeSubject</code>. The same Map instance is
 * guaranteed to be passed to all methods in the call sequence. Furthermore, it should be assumed that each call
 * sequence is passed its own unique shared state Map instance.
