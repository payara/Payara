 * ServerAuthModule.secureResponse        null      non-null
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * As noted above, in the case of <code>ServerAuthModule.validateRequest</code> the module receives a null response
 * object. If the implementation of <code>validateRequest</code> encounters an authentication error, it may construct
 * the appropriate response object itself and set it into the HttpServletAuthParam via the <code>setResponse</code>
