 * This interface describes a module that can be configured for a ServerAuthContext. The main purpose of this module is
 * to validate client requests and to secure responses back to the client.
 *
 * <p>
 * A module implementation must assume it may be shared across different requests from different clients. It is the
 * module implementation's responsibility to properly store and restore any state necessary to associate new requests
 * with previous responses. A module that does not need to do so may remain completely stateless.
 *
 * <p>
 * Modules are passed a shared state Map that can be used to save state across a sequence of calls from
 * <code>validateRequest</code> to <code>secureResponse</code> to <code>disposeSubject</code>. The same Map instance is
 * guaranteed to be passed to all methods in the call sequence. Furthermore, it should be assumed that each call
 * sequence is passed its own unique shared state Map instance.
