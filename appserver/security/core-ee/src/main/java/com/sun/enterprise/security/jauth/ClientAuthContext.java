/**
 * This ClientAuthContext class manages AuthModules that may be used to secure requests made as a client. A caller
 * typically uses this class in the following manner:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Retrieve an instance of this class via AuthConfig.getClientAuthContext.
 * <li>Invoke <i>secureRequest</i>. <br>
 * ClientAuthContext implementation invokes configured plug-in modules. Modules attach credentials to initial request
 * object (for example, a username and password), and/or secure the request (for example, sign and encrypt the request).
 * <li>Issue request.
 * <li>Receive response and pass it to <i>validateResponse</i>. <br>
 * ClientAuthContext implementation invokes configured plug-in modules. Modules verify or decrypt response as necessary.
 * <li>The <i>disposeSubject</i> method may be invoked if necessary to clean up any authentication state in the Subject.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An instance may reuse module instances it previously created. As a result a single module instance may be used to
 * issue different requests as different clients. It is the module implementation's responsibility to properly store and
 * restore any necessary state. A module that does not need to do so may remain completely stateless.
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class have custom logic to determine what modules to invoke, and in what order. In addition, this
 * custom logic may control whether subsequent modules are invoked based on the success or failure of previously invoked
 * modules.
 *
 * <p>
 * The caller is responsible for passing in a state Map that can be used by underlying modules to save state across a
 * sequence of calls from <code>secureRequest</code> to <code>validateResponse</code> to <code>disposeSubject</code>.
 * The same Map instance must be passed to all methods in the call sequence. Furthermore, each call sequence should be
 * passed its own unique shared state Map instance.
