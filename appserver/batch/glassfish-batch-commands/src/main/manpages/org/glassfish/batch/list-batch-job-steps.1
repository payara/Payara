DESCRIPTION
       The list-batch-job-steps subcommand lists steps for a specific batch
       job execution.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which to list batch job steps. Valid
           values are as follows:

           server
               Lists steps for the default server instance server and is the
               default value.

           instance-name
               Lists steps for a particular server instance.

       --long, -l
           Displays detailed information about batch job steps. The default
           value is false.

       --output, -o
           Displays specific details about batch job steps. Use a
           comma-separated list to specify the details to display and their
           order. The values are case-insensitive. A subset of all possible
           headings is displayed by default.

           Possible values are as follows:

           stepname
               Displays the name of the step.

           stepid
               Displays the step ID.

           starttime
               Displays the start time of the step.

           endtime
               Displays the finish time of the step.

           batchstatus
               Displays the status of the step as set by the batch runtime.

           exitstatus
               Displays the status of the step as set by the Job XML for the
               job or by the batch application. By default, the exit status
               and the batch status are the same unless the exit status is
               explicitly overridden.

           stepmetrics
               Displays metrics for the step.

           value
               Displays a value for each step metric. The value represents the
               number of items read, written, committed, and so on.

       --header, -h
           Specifies whether column headings are displayed when the --long
           option is used. The default value is true. To suppress the
           headings, set the --header option to false.

OPERANDS
       execution_id
           The ID of the execution for which to list batch job steps and
           details.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Listing Batch Job Steps
           This example lists batch job steps and specific step details for a
           job execution with the execution ID of 7. The target is the default
           server instance.

           Some lines of output are omitted from this example for readability.
