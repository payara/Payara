NAME
       set-batch-runtime-configuration - configures the batch runtime

SYNOPSIS
           set-batch-runtime-configuration [--help]
           [--target target]
           [--datasourcelookupname datasource-lookup-name]
           [--executorservicelookupname executor-service-lookup-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The set-batch-runtime-configuration subcommand configures the batch
       runtime. The runtime uses a data source and a managed executor service
       to execute batch jobs. Batch runtime configuration data is stored in
       the config element in domain.xml.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which to configure the batch runtime.
           Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Configures the batch runtime for the default server instance
               server and is the default value.

           cluster-name
               Configures the batch runtime for every server instance in the
               cluster.

           instance-name
               Configures the batch runtime for a particular server instance.

       --datasourcelookupname, -d
           The JNDI lookup name of the data source to be used to store job
           information. The default data source is jdbc/__TimerPool.

           Do not change the data source after the first batch job has been
           submitted to the batch runtime for execution. If the data source
           must be changed, stop and restart the domain and then make the
           change before any jobs are started or restarted. However, once the
           data source has been changed, information stored in the previous
           data source becomes inaccessible.

       --executorservicelookupname , -x
           The JNDI lookup name of the managed executor service to be used to
           provide threads to jobs. The default managed executor service is
           concurrent/__defaultManagedExecutorService.

           The managed executor service can be changed after a batch job has
           been submitted to the batch runtime without impacting execution of
           the job.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Configuring the Batch Runtime
           The following example configures the batch runtime for the default
           server instance to use an existing managed executor service named
           concurrent/myExecutor.

               asadmin> set-batch-runtime-configuration --executorservicelookupname concurrent/myExecutor
               Command set-batch-runtime-configuration executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           subcommand executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the subcommand
