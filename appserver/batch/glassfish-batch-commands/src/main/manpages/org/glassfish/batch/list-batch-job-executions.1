DESCRIPTION
       The list-batch-job-executions subcommand lists batch job executions and
       execution details.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which to list batch job executions and
           execution details. Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Lists executions for the default server instance server and is
               the default value.

           instance-name
               Lists executions for a particular server instance.

       --executionid, -x
           Specifies the execution ID of a specific batch job execution.

       --long, -l
           Displays detailed information about batch job executions. The
           default value is false.

       --output, -o
           Displays specific details about batch job executions. Use a
           comma-separated list to specify the details to display and their
           order. The values are case-insensitive. A subset of all possible
           headings is displayed by default.

           Possible values are as follows:

           jobname
               Displays the name of the job.

           executionid
               Displays the ID assigned to the execution of the batch job. A
               new execution is created the first time a job is started and
               every time the existing execution is restarted.

           starttime
               Displays the start time of the execution.

           endtime
               Displays the finish time of the execution.

           batchstatus
               Displays the status of the execution as set by the batch
               runtime.

           exitstatus
               Displays the status of the execution as set by the Job XML for
               the job or by the batch application. By default, the exit
               status and the batch status are the same unless the exit status
               is explicitly overridden.

           jobparameters
               Displays the properties passed to the batch runtime for the
               batch job execution, listed as name/value pairs.

           stepcount
               Displays the number of steps in the batch job execution.

       --header, -h
           Specifies whether column headings are displayed when the --long
           option is used. The default value is true. To suppress the
           headings, set the --header option to false.

OPERANDS
       instance_id
           The ID of the job instance for which to list execution details.
