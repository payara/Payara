DESCRIPTION
       The list-batch-jobs subcommand lists batch jobs and job details.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which to list batch jobs and job details.
           Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Lists batch jobs for the default server instance server and is
               the default value.

           cluster-name
               Lists batch jobs for every server instance in the cluster.

           instance-name
               Lists batch jobs for a particular server instance.

       --long, -l
           Displays detailed information about batch jobs. The default value
           is false.

       --output, -o
           Displays specific details about batch jobs. Use a comma-separated
           list to specify the details to display and their order. The values
           are case-insensitive. The jobname and instancecount column headings
           are displayed by default.

           Possible values are as follows:

           jobname
               Displays the name of the job.

           appname
               Displays the name of the application.

           instancecount
               Displays the number of job instances.

           instanceid
               Displays the ID assigned to the job instance.

           executionid
               Displays the ID assigned to the execution of the batch job. A
               new execution is created the first time a job is started and
               every time the existing execution is restarted.

           batchstatus
               Displays the status of the job as set by the batch runtime.

           starttime
               Displays the start time of the job.

           endtime
               Displays the finish time of the job.

           exitstatus
               Displays the status of the job as set by the Job XML for the
               job or by the batch application. By default, the exit status
               and the batch status are the same unless the exit status is
               explicitly overridden.

       --header, -h
           Specifies whether column headings are displayed when the --long
           option is used. The default value is true. To suppress the
           headings, set the --header option to false.

OPERANDS
       job_name
           The name of the job for which to list details.
