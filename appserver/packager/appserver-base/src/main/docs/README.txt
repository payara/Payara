Thank you for downloading Payara Server 5.2020.2!

Here are a few short steps to get you started...

1. Installing Payara Server
===========================

Installing Payara Server is just a matter of unzipping the Payara Server archive in the desired directory. Since you are reading this, you have probably already unzipped Payara Server. If not, just type the following command in the directory where you want Payara Server to be installed: jar xvf payara-5.2020.2.zip

The default domain called 'domain1' is already installed and preconfigured.


2. Starting Payara Server
=========================

The 'asadmin' command-line utility is used to control and manage Payara Server (start, stop, configure, deploy applications, etc.).

To start Payara Server, just go in the directory where Payara Server is located and type:
        On Unix: payara5/bin/asadmin start-domain
        On Windows: payara5\bin\asadmin start-domain

After a few seconds, Payara Server will be up and ready to accept requests. The default 'domain1' domain is configured to listen on port 8080. In your browser, go to http://localhost:8080 to see the default landing page.

To manage Payara Server, just go to web administration console: http://localhost:4848


3. Stopping Payara Server
=========================

To stop Payara Server, just issue the following command:
        On Unix: payara5/bin/asadmin stop-domain
