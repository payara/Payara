The default domain called 'domain1' is installed and preconfigured.


2. Starting Payara Server

        On Unix: payara41/bin/asadmin start-domain

After a few seconds, Payara Server will be up and ready to accept requests. The default 'domain1' domain is configured to listen on port 8080. In your browser, go to http://localhost:8080 to see the default landing page.
