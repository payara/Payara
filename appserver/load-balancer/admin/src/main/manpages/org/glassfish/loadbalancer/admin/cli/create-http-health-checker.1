           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           This subcommand is only      |
           |           applicable to Oracle         |
           |           GlassFish Server. This       |
           |           subcommand is not applicable |
           |           to GlassFish Server Open     |

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --url
           The URL to ping to determine whether the instance is healthy.

       --interval
           The interval in seconds the health checker waits between checks of
           an unhealthy instance to see whether it has become healthy. The
           default value is 30 seconds. A value of 0 disables the health
           checker.

       --timeout
           The interval in seconds the health checker waits to receive a
           response from an instance. If the health checker has not received a
           response in this interval, the instance is considered unhealthy.

       --config
           The load balancer configuration for which you create the
           health-checker. If you do not specify a configuration, the
           subcommand creates a health checker for every load balancer
           configuration associated with the target. If no configuration
           references the target, the subcommand fails.

OPERANDS
       target
           Specifies the target to which the health checker applies.

           Valid values are:

           *   cluster_name- The name of a target cluster.

           *   instance_name- The name of a target server instance.
