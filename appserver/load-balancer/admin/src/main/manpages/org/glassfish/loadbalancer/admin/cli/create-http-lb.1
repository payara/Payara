DESCRIPTION
       Use the create-http-lb subcommand to create a load balancer, including
       the load balancer configuration, target reference, and health checker.
       A load balancer is a representation of the actual load balancer device,
       defined by its device host and port information. Once you've created
       the load balancer, you can automatically apply changes made to the load
       balancer configuration without running export-http-lb-config and
       manually copying the generated load balancer configuration file to the
       web server instance.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --devicehost
           The device host or the IP address of the load balancing device.
           This host or IP is where the physical load balancer will reside.

       --deviceport
           The port used to communicate with the load balancing device. It
           must be SSL enabled.

       --sslproxyhost
           The proxy host used for outbound HTTP.

       --sslproxyport
           The proxy port used for outbound HTTP.

       --target
           Specifies the target to which the load balancer applies.

           Valid values are:

           *   cluster_name- Specifies that requests for this cluster will be
               handled by the load balancer.

           *   stand-alone_instance_name- Specifies that requests for this
               stand-alone instance will be handled by the load balancer.

       --lbpolicy
           The policy the load balancer follows to distribute load to the
           server instances in a cluster. Valid values are round-robin,
           weighted-round-robin, and user-defined. If you choose user-defined,
           specify a load balancer policy module with the lbpolicymodule
           option. If you choose weighted-round-robin, assign weights to the
           server instances using the configure-lb-weight subcommand. The
           default is round-robin.

       --lbpolicymodule
           If your target is a cluster and the load balancer policy is
           user-defined, use this option to specify the full path and name of
           the shared library of your load balancing policy module. The shared
           library needs to be in a location accessible by the web server.

       --healthcheckerurl
           The URL to ping to determine whether the instance is healthy.

       --healthcheckerinterval
           The interval in seconds the health checker waits between checks of
           an unhealthy instance to see whether it has become healthy. The
           default value is 10 seconds. A value of 0 disables the health
           checker.

       --healthcheckertimeout
           The interval in seconds the health checker waits to receive a
           response from an instance. If the health checker has not received a
           response in this interval, the instance is considered unhealthy.
           The default value is 10 seconds.

       --lbenableallinstances
           Enables all instances in the target cluster for load balancing. If
           the target is a server instance, enables that instance for load
           balancing.

       --lbenableallapplications
           Enables all applications deployed to the target cluster or instance
           for load balancing.

       --lbweight
           The name of the instance and the weight you are assigning it. The
           weight must be an integer. The pairs of instances and weights are
           separated by colons. For example instance1=1:instance2=4 means that
           for every five requests, one goes to instance1 and four go to
           instance2. A weight of 1 is the default.

       --responsetimeout
           The time in seconds within which a server instance must return a
           response. If no response is received within the time period, the
           server is considered unhealthy. If set to a positive number, and
           the request is idempotent, the request is retried. If the request
           is not idempotent, an error page is returned. If set to 0 no
           timeout is used. The default is 60.

       --httpsrouting
           If set to true, HTTPS requests to the load balancer result in HTTPS
           requests to the server instance. If set to false, HTTPS requests to
           the load balancer result in HTTP requests to the server instance.
           The default is false.

       --reloadinterval
           The time, in seconds, that the load balancer takes to check for an
           updated configuration. When detected, the configuration file is
           reloaded. The default value is 60 seconds. A value of 0 disables
           reloading.

       --monitor
           If set to true, monitoring of the load balancer is switched on. The
           default value is false.

       --routecookie
           This option is deprecated. The value is always true.

       --property
           Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the load
           balancer.

OPERANDS
       lb_name
           The name of the new load balancer. This name must not conflict with
           any other load balancers in the domain.
