disable-http-lb-application(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands  disable-http-lb-application(1)

NAME
       disable-http-lb-application - disables an application managed by a load
       balancer

SYNOPSIS
           disable-http-lb-application [--help] [--timeout 30]
            --name application_name target

DESCRIPTION
       The disable disable-http-lb-application subcommand disables an
       application for load balancing. The disabled application goes offline
       for load balancing with minimal impact to users. Disabling an
       application gives a finer granularity of control than disabling a
       server instance and is most useful when a cluster is hosting multiple
       independent applications.

       Once the application is disabled and the changes have been applied to
       the load balancer, new requests for the application are not forwarded
       to the target. Existing sessions continue to access the application
       until the timeout is reached. This process is known as quiescing.

       If an application is deployed across multiple clusters, use this
       subcommand to disable it in one cluster while leaving it enabled in
       others.

       If an application is deployed to a single server instance, use this
       subcommand to disable it in that instance while leaving the instance
       itself enabled.
