       the load balancer

SYNOPSIS
           apply-http-lb-changes [--help]
            lb-name

DESCRIPTION
       Use the applyhttp-lb-changes subcommand to apply the changes in the
       load balancer configuration to the physical load balancer. The load
       balancer must already exist. To create a physical load balancer, use
       the create-http-lb subcommand.

       This subcommand is only applicable to Oracle GlassFish Server. This
       subcommand is not applicable to GlassFish Server Open Source Edition.

CONTEXT
       The Load Balancer distributes the workload among multiple Oracle
       GlassFish Server instances , increasing the overall throughput of the
       system. The Load Balancer also enables requests to failover from one
       server instance to another. For HTTP session information to persist,
       configure HTTP session persistence.
