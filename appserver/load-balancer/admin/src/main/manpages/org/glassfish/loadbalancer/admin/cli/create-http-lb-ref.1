NAME
       create-http-lb-ref - adds an existing cluster or server instance to an
       existing load balancer configuration or load balancer

SYNOPSIS
           create-http-lb-ref [--help] --config config_name | --lbname load_balancer_name
           [--lbpolicy round-robin] [--lbpolicymodule lb_policy_module]

           target

DESCRIPTION
       Use the create-http-lb-ref subcommand to:

       *   Add an existing cluster or server instance to an existing load
           balancer configuration or load balancer. The load balancer forwards
           the requests to the clustered and standalone instances it
           references.

       *   Set the load balancing policy to round-robin, weighted round-robin,
           or to a user-defined policy.

       *   Configure a health checker for the load balancer. Any health
           checker settings defined here apply only to the target. If you do
           not create a health checker with this subcommand, use
           create-http-health-checker.

       *   Enable all instances in the target cluster for load balancing, or
           use enable-http-lb-server to enable them individually.

       *   Enable all applications deployed to the target for load balancing,
           or use enable-http-lb-application to enable them individually.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --config
           Specifies which load balancer configuration to which to add
           clusters and server instances. Specify either a load balancer
           configuration or a load balancer. Specifying both results in an
           error.

       --lbname
           Specifies the load balancer to which to add clusters and server
           instances. Specify either a load balancer configuration or a load
           balancer. Specifying both results in an error.

       --lbpolicy
           The policy the load balancer follows. Valid values are round-robin,
           weighted-round-robin, and user-defined. If you choose user-defined,
           specify a load balancer policy module with the lbpolicymodule
           option. If you choose weighted-round-robin assign weights to the
           server instances using the configure-lb-weight subcommand. The
           default is round-robin.

       --lbpolicymodule
           If your load balancer policy is user-defined, use this option to
           specify the full path and name of the shared library of your load
           balancing policy module. The shared library needs to be in a
           location accessible by the web server.

       --healthcheckerurl
           The URL to ping to determine whether the instance is healthy.

       --healthcheckerinterval
           The interval in seconds the health checker waits between checks of
           an unhealthy instance to see whether it has become healthy. The
           default value is 30 seconds. A value of 0 disables the health
           checker.

       --healthcheckertimeout
           The interval in seconds the health checker waits to receive a
           response from an instance. If the health checker has not received a
           response in this interval, the instance is considered unhealthy.
           The default is 10.

       --lbenableallinstances
           Enables all instances in the target cluster for load balancing. If
           the target is a server instance, enables that instance for load
           balancing. The default value is true.

       --lbenableallapplications
           Enables all applications deployed to the target cluster or instance
           for load balancing. The default value is true.

       --lbweight
           The name of the instance and the weight you are assigning it. The
           weight must be an integer. The pairs of instances and weights are
           separated by colons. For example instance1=1:instance2=4 means that
           for every five requests, one goes to instance1 and four go to
           instance2. A weight of 1 is the default.

OPERANDS
       target
           Specifies which cluster or instance to add to the load balancer.
           Valid values are:

           *   cluster_name- Specifies that requests for this cluster will be
               handled by the load balancer.

           *   stand-alone_instance_name- Specifies that requests for this
               standalone instance will be handled by the load balancer.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Adding a Cluster Reference to a Load Balancer Configuration
           This example adds a reference to a cluster named cluster2 to a load
           balancer configuration named mylbconfig.

               asadmin> create-http-lb-ref --config mylbconfig cluster2

               Command create-http-lb-ref executed successfully.

       Example 2, Adding a Cluster Reference to a Load Balancer
           This example adds a reference to a cluster named cluster2 to a load
           balancer named mylb.

               asadmin> create-http-lb-ref --lbname mylb cluster2

               Command create-http-lb-ref executed successfully.

       Example 3, Configuring a Health Checker and Load Balancer Policy
           This example configures a health checker and load balancing policy,
           and enables the load balancer for instances and applications.

               asadmin> create-http-lb-ref --config mylbconfig --lbpolicy weighted-round-robin
               --healthcheckerinterval 40 --healthcheckertimeout 20
               --lbenableallinstances=true --lbenableallapplications=true cluster2

               Command create-http-lb-ref executed successfully.

       Example 4, Setting a User-Defined Load Balancing Policy
           This example sets a user-defined load balancing policy.

               asadmin> create-http-lb-ref --lbpolicy user-defined --lbpolicymodule /user/modules/module.so
