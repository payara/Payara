configure-lb-weight(1)    asadmin Utility Subcommands   configure-lb-weight(1)

NAME
       configure-lb-weight - sets load balancing weights for clustered
       instances

SYNOPSIS
           configure-lb-weight [--help] --cluster cluster_name
            instance-name=weight[:instance-name=weight]

DESCRIPTION
       The configure-lb-weight subcommand assigns weight to the server
       instances in a cluster. Weights can be used for HTTP, RMI/IIOP and JMS
       load balancing. For the HTTP load balancer, the weights are used only
       if the load balancer's policy is set to weighted-round-robin. The load
       balancer policy is set in the create-http-lb-ref subcommand or set
       subcommand.

       Use the weight to vary the load going to different instances in the
       cluster. For example, if an instance is on a machine with more
       capacity, give it a higher weight so that more requests are sent to
       that instance by the load balancer. The default weight is 100. If all
       instances have the default weight, the load balancer performs simple
       round robin load balancing.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           This subcommand is only      |
           |           applicable to Oracle         |
           |           GlassFish Server. This       |
           |           subcommand is not applicable |
           |           to GlassFish Server Open     |
           |           Source Edition.              |

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --cluster
           The name of the cluster.

OPERANDS
       instance-name=weight
           The name of the instance and the weight you are assigning it. The
           weight must be an integer. The pairs of instances and weights are
           separated by colons. For example instance1=1:instance2=4 means that
           for every five requests, one goes to instance1 and four go to
           instance2. A weight of 1 is the default.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Assigning Load Balancer Weights to Cluster Instances
           The following subcommand assigns weights of 1, 1, and 2 to
           instances i1, i2, and i3 in the cluster1 cluster.

               asadmin> configure-lb-weight --cluster cluster1 i1=1:i2=1:i3=2
               Command configure-lb-weight executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           subcommand executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the subcommand
