disable-http-lb-server(1)           asadmin Utility Subcommands          disable-http-lb-server(1)

NAME
       disable-http-lb-server - disables a sever or cluster managed by a load
       balancer

SYNOPSIS
           disable-http-lb-server [--help] [--timeout 30]
            target

DESCRIPTION
       The disable-http-lb-server subcommand disables a standalone server or
       cluster of servers for load balancing. The disabled server instance or
       cluster goes offline for load balancing with a minimum impact to users.

       Once the target has been disabled and the changes have been applied to
       the load balancer, the load balancer stops assigning new requests to
       the target. Session requests with sessions created before disabling the
       target continue to be assigned to that target until the timeout is
       reached. This process is known as quiescing.

       Changes are applied the load balancer automatically. You can also
       manually export the configuration using export-http-lb-config and copy
       it to the load balancer.
