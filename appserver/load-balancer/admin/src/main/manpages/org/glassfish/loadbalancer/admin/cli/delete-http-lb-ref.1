delete-http-lb-ref(1)     asadmin Utility Subcommands    delete-http-lb-ref(1)

NAME
       delete-http-lb-ref - deletes the cluster or server instance from a load
       balancer

SYNOPSIS
           delete-http-lb-ref [--help] --config config_name | --lbname load_balancer_name
           [--force=false] target

DESCRIPTION
       Use the delete-http-lb-ref subcommand to remove a reference to a
       cluster or standalone server instance from a load balancer
       configuration or load balancer. So that you do not interrupt user
       requests, make sure the standalone server instance or all server
       instances in the cluster are disabled before you remove them from the
       load balancer configuration. If the force option is set to true, the
       references are deleted even if server instances or clusters are
       enabled.
