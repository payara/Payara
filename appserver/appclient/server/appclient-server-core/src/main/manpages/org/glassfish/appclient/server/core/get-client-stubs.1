get-client-stubs(1)       asadmin Utility Subcommands      get-client-stubs(1)

NAME
       get-client-stubs - retrieves the application JAR files needed to launch
       the application client.

SYNOPSIS
           get-client-stubs [--help] --appname application_name local_directory_path

DESCRIPTION
       The get-client-stubs subcommand copies the required JAR files for an
       AppClient standalone module or each AppClient module in an application
       from the server machine to the local directory. Each client's generated
       JAR file is retrieved, along with any required supporting JAR files .
       The client JAR file name is of the form app-nameClient.jar. Before
       executing the get-client-stubs subcommand, you must deploy the
       application or module. The generated client JAR file is useful for
       running the application using the appclient utility. This subcommand is
       supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --appname
           The name of the application or stand-alone client module.

           The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows
           the name and is separated from the name by a colon (:). The version
           identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain
           alphanumeric characters plus underscore (_), dash (-), and period
           (.) characters. For more information about module and application
           versions, see "Module and Application Versions" in Oracle GlassFish
           Server Application Deployment Guide.

OPERANDS
       local_directory_path
           The path to the local directory where the client stub JAR file
           should be stored.
