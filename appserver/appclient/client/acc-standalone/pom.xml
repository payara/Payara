    <!--
        This module builds the free-standing JAR file for the app client
        container which can be run without using an OSGi implementation.

        This module contains little source of its own but mostly packages a JAR
        with a manifest Class-Path that specifies all the OSGi JARs on which
        it directly or indirectly depends.

        Note that additional JARs which clients might need but which are not
        declared as dependencies are added by updating the generated manifest's
        Class-Path using some ant tasks.  The nicer way to do this would be to
        create a custom plug-in which would delegate most of the work to the
        archiver but would augment the generated Class-Path with the extra JARs.
        Perhaps later.

                reformat the contents of the file so it's useful in the manifest.
