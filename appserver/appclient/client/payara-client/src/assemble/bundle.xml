    Describes how to create the zip file for the non-OSGi ACC bundle.

    Because of the way some other modules are organized, the ACC module's
    transitive closure of dependencies includes modules that it will never
    use at runtime.  This is the case, for example, because the published
    security API for programmatic login implements both the server-side and
    the client-side login methods in the same class.  That means that the ACC's
    dependence on the security module which defines the API would seem to
    create a further dependency on other, server-side-only modules.  This
    descriptor excludes such modules from the bundle.
