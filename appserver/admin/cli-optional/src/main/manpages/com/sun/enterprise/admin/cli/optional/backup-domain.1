DESCRIPTION
       The backup-domain subcommand backs up files under the named domain.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only in GlassFish Server
       Open Source Edition, and is supported in local mode and remote mode in
       Oracle GlassFish Server.

       In GlassFish Server Open Source Edition, the domain to be backed up
       must be stopped.

       In Oracle GlassFish Server, the domain to be backed up must be stopped
       or be suspended using the suspend-domain(1) subcommand.

           Displays detailed information about the backup operation.

           The default value is false.

       --description
           Specifies a description to store in the backup file. The
           description is displayed as part of the information about a backup
           file.

           The default value has this form:

       --backupdir
           Specifies the directory under which the backup file is to be
           stored.

           The default value is as-install/domains/domain-dir/backups. If the
           domain is not in the default location, the location is
           domain-dir/backups.
