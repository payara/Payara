stop-database(1)          asadmin Utility Subcommands         stop-database(1)

NAME
       stop-database - stops the Java database

SYNOPSIS
           stop-database [--help] [--dbuser db-user]
           [--dbhost host] [--dbport port-no]

DESCRIPTION
       The stop-database subcommand stops a process of the Java databse server.
       Java database server is available for use with Payara Server and is based
       upon H2. The database is typically started with the
       start-database(1) subcommand. A single host can have multiple database
       server processes running on different ports. The stop-database
       subcommand stops the database server process for the specified port
       only.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --dbuser
           The user name of the H2 user that is to stop the server
           process. This option is required only when H2 user
           authentication is enabled.

           If this option is omitted, no user is specified. By default, H2 
           user authentication is disabled, so no user or password is
           required.

       --dbhost
           The host name or IP address of the H2 server process. The
           default is the IP address 0.0.0.0, which denotes all network
           interfaces on the host where you run the stop-database subcommand.

       --dbport
           The port number where the H2 server listens for client
           connections. The default is 9092.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Stopping H2 database
           This example stops H2 database on host host1 and port 5001.

               asadmin> stop-database --dbhost host1 --dbport 5001
               Connection obtained for host: host1, port number 5001.
               Shutdown successful.
               Command stop-database executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status applies to errors in executing the asadmin utility. For
       information on database errors, see the h2.log file. This file is
       located in the directory you specify by using the --dbhome option when
       you run the start-database subcommand. If you did not specify --dbhome,
       the value of H2_INSTALL defaults to as-install/h2db.
