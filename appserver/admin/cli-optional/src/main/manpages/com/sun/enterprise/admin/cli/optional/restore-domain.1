DESCRIPTION
       This command restores files under the domain from a backup directory.

       The restore-domain command is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --long, -l
           Displays detailed information about the restore operation.

           The default value is false.

       --filename
           Specifies the name of the backup file to use as the source.

       --domaindir
           Specifies the domain root directory, the parent directory of the
           domain to restore.

           The default value is as-install/domains.

       --backupdir
           Specifies the directory under which the backup file is stored.

           The default value is as-install/domains/domain-dir/backups. If the
           domain is not in the default location, the location is
           domain-dir/backups.

       --backupconfig
           (Supported only in Oracle GlassFish Server.) The name of the domain
           backup configuration in the backup directory under which the backup
           file is stored.

       --force
           Causes the restore operation to continue even when the name of the
           domain to restore does not match the name of the domain stored in
           the backup file.

           The default value is false.

OPERANDS
       domain-name
           Specifies the name of the domain to restore.

           This operand is optional if only one domain exists in the GlassFish
           Server installation.

           If the specified domain name does not match the domain name stored
           in the backup file, an error occurs unless the --force option is
           specified.
