Contains the classes and interfaces that implement server side of JSR 160 for S1AS 8.0.
As of 08/03/2003, this implementation is internal and to be used only by the
command line interface over HTTP. This package contains the server side
elements.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The implemented standard is JSR 160. The server side is handled by one single
servlet that uses Java Serialization for the communication of Objects. All the
Objects that are transmitted over wire are wrapped in instances of
MBeanServerResponseMessage and MBeanServerRequestMessage. The version 
information is also taken care of.
