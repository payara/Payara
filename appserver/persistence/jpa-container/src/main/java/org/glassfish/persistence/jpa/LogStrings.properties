# messages used in jpa-connector module
#
# The message ID for a message in persistence is derived as follows:
# PER<2_digit_bundle_prefix><1_digit_section_number><2_digit_serial_number>
#
# The 2 digit prefix for this bundle is 02.
#
# This file is divided into the following sections:
# Under each section, messages that need not be I18Ned are separated under NOI18N. All other messages
# need to be numbered.
# 1. PersistenceUnitInfoImpl: Messages used in PersistenceUnitInfoImpl
# 2. PersistenceUnitLoader: Messages used in PersistenceUnitLoader
#
# When adding a new message:
# 1. Please make sure that you add the message to the end.
# 2. Please add message ID to any user visible message.
# 3. The message ID for the new message = message ID for the last numbered
#    message in a section + 1.
# 4. Please do not change the message ID for existing messages. These
#    numbers are potentially mapped to more explanation about the message for
#    the end user.
