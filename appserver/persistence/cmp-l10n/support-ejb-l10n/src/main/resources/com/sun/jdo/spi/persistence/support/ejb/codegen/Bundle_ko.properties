# resource bundle for the messages
# key consists of: <PREFIX_><description>
# key consists of: <PREFIX><delimiter><description>
# <PREFIX> - any valid prefix like MSG, EXC, etc.
# CMG prefix is used for CMP code generation messages.
# <delimiter> can be '_' or '.'.
# <description> - short description started with the upper case letter and used
# upper case to represent each next word.
#
# The message ID for a message in persistence is derived as follows:
# JDO<2_digit_bundle_prefix><1_digit_section_number><2_digit_serial_number>
#
# The 2 digit prefix for this bundle is 74.
# 
# When adding a new message:
# 1. Please make sure that you add the message to the end of the file.
# 2. Please add message ID to any user visible message.
# 3. The message ID for the new message = message ID for the last numbered 
#    message in the file + 1.
# 4. Please do not change message number for existing messages. These numbers 
#    are potentially mapped to more explanation about the message for the end 
#    user.
