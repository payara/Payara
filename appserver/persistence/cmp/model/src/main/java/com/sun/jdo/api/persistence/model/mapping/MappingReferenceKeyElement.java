/** 
 * This is an element which represents a relationship between two tables
 * (primary and secondary).  It should not be used for relationship fields 
 * (MappingRelationshipElement has its own set of pairs).  It can be thought 
 * of as a "fake foreign key" meaning it designates the column pairs used to 
 * join the primary table with a secondary table.  It is analagous to a 
 * foreign key and may in fact contain identical pairs as the foreign key, 
 * but this is not a requirement.  The foreign key may define a different 
 * set of pairs or may not exist at all.  Although any set of pairs is legal, 
 * the user should be careful to define pairs which represent a logical 
 * relationship between the two tables.  The relationship should be set up as 
 * follows: 
 * First, set a primary table for the mapping class.  Doing this sets up a 
 * "fake primary key" for the associated mapping table element.  Next, add 
 * a secondary table and set up the pairs which establish the connection 
 * on the returned reference key object.  This sets up whatever "fake primary 
 * key" information is necessary on the secondary table's mapping table, 
 * establishes the primary to secondary relationship via the reference keys, 
 * and puts the pair information into the "fake foreign key".
