# ResourceBundle properties file for model messages
# key consists of: <subpackage>.<category>.<description>
# <subpackage> - is optional, package under model
# <category> - relationships, all elements, etc.
# <description> - short description (use _ to represent space)
# all keys should be in lowercase
#
# Some of the messages from this file are overridden in 
# mapping/ejb/src/com/sun/jdo/api/persistence/model/Bundle_ejb.properties
# and 
# support/ejb/src/com/sun/jdo/spi/persistence/support/ejb/model/Bundle.properties
#
# The message ID for a message in persistence is derived as follows:
# JDO<2_digit_bundle_prefix><1_digit_section_number><2_digit_serial_number>
#
# The 2 digit prefix for this bundle is 72.
#
# This file is divided into the following sections:
# 0. Top level model messages.
# 1. JDO model messages.
# 2. Mapping model messages.
# 3. Validation messages.
#
# IMPORTANT: When adding a new message in the validation section,
# realize that it is split into the following sub sections:
#     classes
#     fields
#     database elements
#     key class elements
# Since the messages should be grouped by sub section, the order of messageID's
# may not be sequential, so the last numbered message ID for the section 
# is stored in a comment at the end of the entire validation section.
#
# When adding a new message:
# 1. Please make sure that you add the message to the end of appropriate section.
# 2. Please add message ID to any user visible message.
# 3. The message ID for the new message = message ID for the last numbered 
#    message in a section + 1.
# 4. Please do not change the message ID for existing messages. These 
#    numbers are potentially mapped to more explanation about the message for 
#    the end user.
