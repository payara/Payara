/**
 * A <b>Host</b> is a Container that represents a virtual host in the
 * Catalina servlet engine.  It is useful in the following types of scenarios:
 * <ul>
 * <li>You wish to use Interceptors that see every single request processed
 *     by this particular virtual host.
 * <li>You wish to run Catalina in with a standalone HTTP connector, but still
 *     want support for multiple virtual hosts.
 * </ul>
 * In general, you would not use a Host when deploying Catalina connected
 * to a web server (such as Apache), because the Connector will have
 * utilized the web server's facilities to determine which Context (or
 * perhaps even which Wrapper) should be utilized to process this request.
 * <p>
 * The parent Container attached to a Host is generally an Engine, but may
 * be some other implementation, or may be omitted if it is not necessary.
 * <p>
 * The child containers attached to a Host are generally implementations
 * of Context (representing an individual servlet context).
