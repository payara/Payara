/**
 * Valve that attempts to force MS WebDAV clients connecting on port 80 to use
 * a WebDAV client that actually works. Other workarounds that might help
 * include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Specifing the port, even if it is port 80, when trying to connect.</li>
 *   <li>Canceling the first authentication dialog box and then trying to
 *       reconnect.</li>
 * </ul>
 * To use this valve add the following <code>&lt;Valve
 * className="org.apache.catalina.valves.WebdavFixValve" /&gt;</code>
 * to your <code>Engine</code>, <code>Host</code> or <code>Context</code> as
 * required. Normally, this valve would be used at the <code>Context</code>
