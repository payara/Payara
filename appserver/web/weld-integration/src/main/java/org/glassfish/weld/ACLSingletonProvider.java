 * We can't use TCCLSingletonProvider because thread's context class loader can
 * be different for different modules of a single application (ear).
 * To support Application Scoped beans, Weld needs to be bootstrapped
 * per application as opposed to per module. We rely on the fact that
 * all these module class loaders have a common parent which is per application.
 * We use that parent ApplicationClassLoader to identify the singleton scope.

       * in the context of Java EE, it can assume that Thread's context
       * class loader is always set as application class loader. In GlassFish,
       * the class loader can vary for each module of an Ear. Thread's
       * context class loader is set depending on which module is handling
       * the request. But, fortunately all those embedded module class loaders
       * have a common parent in their delegation chain. That parent
       * is of type EarLibClassLoader. So, this code walks up the delegation
       * chain until it hits either a EarLibClassLoader type of parent or
       * bootstrapClassLoader. If former is the case, it returns that
       * instance of EarLibClassLoader. If latter is the case, it assumes
       * that this is a standalone module and hence it returns the thread's
       * context class loader.
