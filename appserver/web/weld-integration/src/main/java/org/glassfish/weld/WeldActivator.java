/**
 * This is a bundle activator which is responsible for configuring Weld bundle
 * to be used in GlassFish. As part of configuration, it configures the the
 * SingletonProvider in Weld. It sets different SingletonProvider for different
 * profiles. e.g., in WebProfile, it sets
 * {@link org.jboss.weld.bootstrap.api.helpers.TCCLSingletonProvider}, where as
 * for full-javaee profile, it uses
 * {@link org.glassfish.weld.ACLSingletonProvider}. It tests profile by testing
 * existence of {@link org.glassfish.javaee.full.deployment.EarClassLoader}.
 * 
 * Since Weld 1.1, an implementation of the 
 * {@link org.jboss.weld.serialization.spi.ProxyServices} SPI is used to provide
 * a classloader to load javassist defined proxies. This classloader ensures
 * that they can load not only application defined classes but also classes 
 * exported by any OSGi bundle as long as the operation is happening in 
 * the context of a Java EE app.
 * 
 * The bundle activator resets the SingletonProvicer in stop().
