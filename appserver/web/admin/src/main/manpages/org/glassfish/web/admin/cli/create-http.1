DESCRIPTION
       The create-http subcommand creates a set of HTTP parameters for a
       protocol, which in turn configures one or more network listeners. This
       subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --default-virtual-server
           The ID attribute of the default virtual server for the associated
           network listeners.

       --request-timeout-seconds
           The time in seconds at which the request times out. If you do not
           set this option, the request times out in 30 seconds.

       --timeout-seconds
           The maximum time in seconds for which a keep alive connection is
           kept open. A value of 0 or less means keep alive connections are
           kept open indefinitely. The default is 30.

       --max-connection
           The maximum number of HTTP requests that can be pipelined until the
           connection is closed by the server. Set this property to 1 to
           disable HTTP/1.0 keep-alive, as well as HTTP/1.1 keep-alive and
           pipelining. The default is 256.

       --dns-lookup-enabled
           If set to true, looks up the DNS entry for the client. The default
           is false.

       --servername
           Tells the server what to put in the host name section of any URLs
           it sends to the client. This affects URLs the server automatically
           generates; it doesn't affect the URLs for directories and files
           stored in the server. This name should be the alias name if your
           server uses an alias. If a colon and port number are appended, that
           port will be used in URLs that the server sends to the client.

       --target
           Creates the set of HTTP parameters only on the specified target.
           Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Creates the set of HTTP parameters on the default server
               instance. This is the default value.

           configuration-name
               Creates the set of HTTP parameters in the specified
               configuration.

           cluster-name
               Creates the set of HTTP parameters on all server instances in
               the specified cluster.

           standalone-instance-name
               Creates the set of HTTP parameters on the specified standalone
               server instance.

OPERANDS
       protocol-name
           The name of the protocol to which this HTTP parameter set applies.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Using the create-http Subcommand
           The following command creates an HTTP parameter set for the
           protocol named http-1:

               asadmin> create-http --timeout-seconds 60 --default-virtual-server server http-1
               Command create-http executed successfully.
