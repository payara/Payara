DESCRIPTION
       The create-http-listener subcommand creates an HTTP network listener.
       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           If you edit the special HTTP |
           |           network listener named       |
           |           admin-listener, you must     |
           |           restart the server for the   |
           |           changes to take effect. The  |
           |           Administration Console does  |
           |           not tell you that a restart  |
           |           is required in this case.    |
           +----------------------------------------+

           Note

           |           This subcommand is provided  |
           |           for backward compatibility   |
           |           and as a shortcut for        |
           |           creating network listeners   |
           |           that use the HTTP protocol.  |
           |           Behind the scenes, this      |
           |           subcommand creates a network |
           |           listener and its associated  |
           |           protocol, transport, and     |
           |           HTTP configuration.          |
           +----------------------------------------+

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --listeneraddress
           The IP address or the hostname (resolvable by DNS).

       --listenerport
           The port number to create the listen socket on. Legal values are
           1-65535. On UNIX, creating sockets that listen on ports 1-1024
           requires superuser privileges. Configuring an SSL listen socket to
           listen on port 443 is recommended.

       --default-virtual-server, --defaultvs
           The ID attribute of the default virtual server for this listener.
           The --defaultvs option is deprecated.

       --servername
           Tells the server what to put in the host name section of any URLs
           it sends to the client. This affects URLs the server automatically
           generates; it doesn't affect the URLs for directories and files
           stored in the server. This name should be the alias name if your
           server uses an alias. If a colon and port number are appended, that
           port will be used in URLs that the server sends to the client.

       --acceptorthreads
           The number of acceptor threads for the listener socket. The
           recommended value is the number of processors in the machine. The
           default value is 1.

       --xpowered
           If set to true, adds the X-Powered-By: Servlet/3.0 and
           X-Powered-By: JSP/2.0 headers to the appropriate responses. The
           Servlet 3.0 specification defines the X-Powered-By: Servlet/3.0
           header, which containers may add to servlet-generated responses.
           Similarly, the JSP 2.0 specification defines the X-Powered-By:
           JSP/2.0 header, which containers may add to responses that use JSP
           technology. The goal of these headers is to aid in gathering
           statistical data about the use of Servlet and JSP technology. The
           default value is true.

       --redirectport
           Do not specify this option. This option is retained for
           compatibility with earlier releases. If you specify this option, a
           syntax error does not occur. Instead, the subcommand runs
           successfully and displays a warning message that the option is
           ignored.

       --securityenabled
           If set to true, the HTTP listener runs SSL. You can turn SSL2 or
           SSL3 ON or OFF and set ciphers using an SSL element. The security
           setting globally enables or disables SSL by making certificates
           available to the server instance. The default value is false.

       --enabled
           If set to true, the listener is enabled at runtime. The default
           value is true.

       --target
           Creates the HTTP listener only on the specified target. Valid
           values are as follows:

           server
               Creates the HTTP listener on the default server instance. This
               is the default value.

           configuration-name
               Creates the HTTP listener in the specified configuration.

           cluster-name
               Creates the HTTP listener on all server instances in the
               specified cluster.

           standalone-instance-name
               Creates the HTTP listener on the specified standalone server
               instance.

OPERANDS
       listener-id
           The listener ID of the HTTP network listener.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating an HTTP Network Listener
           The following command creates an HTTP network listener named
           sampleListener that uses a nondefault number of acceptor threads
           and is not enabled at runtime:

               asadmin> create-http-listener --listeneraddress 0.0.0.0 --listenerport 7272
               --defaultvs server --servername host1.sun.com --acceptorthreads 100
               --securityenabled=false --enabled=false sampleListener
               Command create-http-listener executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
