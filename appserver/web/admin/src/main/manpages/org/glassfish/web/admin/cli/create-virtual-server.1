DESCRIPTION
       The create-virtual-server subcommand creates the named virtual server.
       Virtualization in the GlassFish Server allows multiple URL domains to
       be served by a single HTTP server process that is listening on multiple
       host addresses. If the application is available at two virtual servers,
       they still share the same physical resource pools.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --hosts
           A comma-separated (,) list of values allowed in the host request
           header to select the current virtual server. Each virtual server
           that is configured to the same connection group must have a unique
           host for that group.

       --httplisteners
           A comma-separated (,) list of HTTP listener IDs. Required only for
           a virtual server that is not the default virtual server. HTTP
           listeners are converted to network listeners. This option is
           deprecated but maintained for backward compatibility. Use
           --networklisteners instead. If --networklisteners is used, this
           option is ignored.

       --networklisteners
           A comma-separated (,) list of network listener IDs. Required only
           for a virtual server that is not the default virtual server.

       --defaultwebmodule
           The standalone web module associated with this virtual server by
           default.

       --state
           Determines whether a virtual server is active (on) or inactive (off
           or disabled). Default is on. When inactive, the virtual server does
           not service requests.

       --logfile
           Name of the file where log entries for this virtual server are to
           be written. By default, this is the server log. The file and
           directory in which the access log is kept must be writable by the
           user account under which the server runs.

       --property
           Optional property name/value pairs for configuring the virtual
           server. The following properties are available:

           sso-max-inactive-seconds
               Specifies the number of seconds after which a user's single
               sign-on record becomes eligible for purging if no client
               activity is received. Since single sign-on applies across
               several applications on the same virtual server, access to any
               of the applications keeps the single sign-on record active. The
               default value is 300 seconds (5 minutes). Higher values provide
               longer single sign-on persistence for users, but at the expense
               of more memory use on the server.

           sso-reap-interval-seconds
               Specifies the number of seconds between purges of expired
               single sign-on records. The default value is 60.

           setCacheControl
               Specifies a comma-separated list of Cache-Control response
               directives. For a list of valid directives, see section 14.9 of
               the document at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt
               (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt).

           allowLinking
               If the value of this property is true, resources that are
               symbolic links will be served for all web applications deployed
               on this virtual server. Individual web applications may
               override this setting by using the property allowLinking under
               the sun-web-app element in the sun-web.xml file:

                   <sun-web-app>
                   <property name="allowLinking" value="[true|false]"/>
                   </sun-web-app>
               The default value is true.

           accessLogWriteInterval
               Indicates the number of seconds before the log will be written
               to the disk. The access log is written when the buffer is full
               or when the interval expires. If the value is 0 (zero), then
               the buffer is always written even if it is not full. This means
               that each time the server is accessed, the log message is
               stored directly to the file.

           accessLogBufferSize
               Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer where access log
               calls are stored.

           allowRemoteAddress
               This is a comma-separated list of regular expression patterns
               to which the remote client's IP address is compared. If this
               property is specified, the remote address must match for this
               request to be accepted. If this property is not specified, all
               requests will be accepted unless the remote address matches a
               denyRemoteAddress pattern. The default value for this property
               is null.

           denyRemoteAddress
               This is a comma-separated list of regular expression patterns
               to which the remote client's IP address is compared. If this
               property is specified, the remote address must not match for
               this request to be accepted. If this property is not specified,
               request acceptance is governed solely by the allowRemoteAddress
               property. The default value for this property is null.

           allowRemoteHost
               This is a comma-separated list of regular expression patterns
               to which the remote client's host name (as returned by
               java.net.Socket.getInetAddress().getHostName()) is compared. If
               this property is specified, the remote host name must match for
               this request to be accepted. If this property is not specified,
               all requests will be accepted unless the remote host name
               matches a denyRemoteHost pattern. The default value for this
               property is null.

           denyRemoteHost
               This is a comma-separated list of regular expression patterns
               to which the remote client's host name (as returned by
               java.net.Socket.getInetAddress().getHostName()) is compared. If
               this property is specified, the remote host name must not match
               for this request to be accepted. If this property is not
               specified, request acceptance is governed solely by the
               allowRemoteHost property. The default value for this property
               is null.

           authRealm
               Specifies the name attribute of an auth-realm, which overrides
               the server instance's default realm for standalone web
               applications deployed to this virtual server. A realm defined
               in a standalone web application's web.xml file overrides the
               virtual server's realm.

           securePagesWithPragma
               Set this property to false to ensure that for all web
               applications on this virtual server file downloads using SSL
               work properly in Internet Explorer.

               You can set this property for a specific web application. For
               details, see "glassfish-web-app" in Oracle GlassFish Server
               Application Deployment Guide.

           contextXmlDefault
               domain-dir, of the context.xml file for this virtual server, if
               one is used. For more information about the context.xml file,
               see "Using a context.xml File" in Oracle GlassFish Server
               Application Development Guide and The Context Container
               (http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/context.html).
               Context parameters, environment entries, and resource
               definitions in context.xml are supported in the GlassFish
               Server.

           alternatedocroot_n
               Specifies an alternate document root (docroot), where n is a
               positive integer that allows specification of more than one.
               Alternate docroots allow web applications to serve requests for
               certain resources from outside their own docroot, based on
               whether those requests match one (or more) of the URI patterns
               of the web application's alternate docroots.

               If a request matches an alternate docroot's URI pattern, it is
               mapped to the alternate docroot by appending the request URI
               (minus the web application's context root) to the alternate
               docroot's physical location (directory). If a request matches
               multiple URI patterns, the alternate docroot is determined
               according to the following precedence order:

               *   Exact match

               *   Longest path match

               *   Extension match

               For example, the following properties specify three alternate
               docroots. The URI pattern of the first alternate docroot uses
               an exact match, whereas the URI patterns of the second and
               third alternate docroots use extension and longest path prefix
               matches, respectively.

                   <property name="alternatedocroot_1"
                      value="from=/my.jpg dir=/srv/images/jpg"/>
                   <property name="alternatedocroot_2"
                      value="from=*.jpg dir=/srv/images/jpg"/>
                   <property name="alternatedocroot_3"
                      value="from=/jpg/* dir=/src/images"/>
               The value of each alternate docroot has two components: The
               first component, from, specifies the alternate docroot's URI
               pattern, and the second component, dir, specifies the alternate
               docroot's physical location (directory). Spaces are allowed in
               the dir component.

               You can set this property for a specific web application. For
               details, see "glassfish-web-app" in Oracle GlassFish Server
               Application Deployment Guide.

           send-error_n
               Specifies custom error page mappings for the virtual server,
               which are inherited by all web applications deployed on the
               virtual server. A web application can override these custom
               error page mappings in its web.xml deployment descriptor. The
               value of each send-error_n property has three components, which
               may be specified in any order:

               The first component, code, specifies the three-digit HTTP
               response status code for which the custom error page should be
               returned in the response.

               The second component, path, specifies the absolute or relative
               file system path of the custom error page. A relative file
               system path is interpreted as relative to the domain-dir/config
               directory.

               The third component, reason, is optional and specifies the text
               of the reason string (such as Unauthorized or Forbidden) to be
               returned.

               For example:

                   <property name="send-error_1"
                      value="code=401 path=/myhost/401.html reason=MY-401-REASON"/>
               This example property definition causes the contents of
               /myhost/401.html to be returned with 401 responses, along with
               this response line:

                   HTTP/1.1 401 MY-401-REASON

           redirect_n
               Specifies that a request for an old URL is treated as a request
               for a new URL. These properties are inherited by all web
               applications deployed on the virtual server. The value of each
               redirect_n property has two components, which may be specified
               in any order:

               The first component, from, specifies the prefix of the
               requested URI to match.

               The second component, url-prefix, specifies the new URL prefix
               to return to the client. The from prefix is simply replaced by
               this URL prefix.

               For example:

                   <property name="redirect_1"
                   value="from=/dummy url-prefix=http://etude"/>

           valve_n
               Specifies a fully qualified class name of a custom valve, where
               n is a positive integer that allows specification of more than
               one. The valve class must implement the
               org.apache.catalina.Valve interface from Tomcat or previous
               GlassFish Server releases, or the
               org.glassfish.web.valve.GlassFishValve interface from the
               current GlassFish Server release. For example:

                   <property name="valve_1"
                      value="org.glassfish.extension.Valve"/>
               You can set this property for a specific web application. For
               details, see "glassfish-web-app" in Oracle GlassFish Server
               Application Deployment Guide.

           listener_n
               Specifies a fully qualified class name of a custom Catalina
               listener, where n is a positive integer that allows
               specification of more than one. The listener class must
               implement the org.apache.catalina.ContainerListener or
               org.apache.catalina.LifecycleListener interface. For example:

                   <property name="listener_1"
                      value="org.glassfish.extension.MyLifecycleListener"/>
               You can set this property for a specific web application. For
               details, see "glassfish-web-app" in Oracle GlassFish Server
               Application Deployment Guide.

           docroot
               Absolute path to root document directory for server.
               Deprecated. Replaced with a virtual-server attribute, docroot,
               that is accessible using the get, set, and list subcommands.

           accesslog
               Absolute path to server access logs. Deprecated. Replaced with

               using the get, set, and list subcommands.

           accessLoggingEnabled
               If true, access logging is enabled for this virtual server.
               Deprecated. Replaced with a virtual-server attribute,
               access-logging-enabled, that is accessible using the get, set,
               and list subcommands.

           sso-enabled
               If true, single sign-on is enabled for web applications on this
               virtual server that are configured for the same realm.
               Deprecated. Replaced with a virtual-server attribute,
               sso-enabled, that is accessible using the get, set, and list
               subcommands.

           ssoCookieSecure
               Sets the Secure attribute of any JSESSIONIDSSO cookies
               associated with the web applications deployed to this virtual
               server. Deprecated. Replaced with a virtual-server attribute,
               sso-cookie-secure, that is accessible using the get, set, and
               list subcommands.

           errorReportValve
               Specifies a fully qualified class name of a custom valve that
               produces default error pages for applications on this virtual
               server. Specify an empty string to disable the default error
               page mechanism for this virtual server.

           cacheTTL
