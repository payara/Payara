unset-web-env-entry(1)    asadmin Utility Subcommands   unset-web-env-entry(1)

NAME
       unset-web-env-entry - unsets an environment entry for a deployed web
       application or module

SYNOPSIS
           unset-web-env-entry [--help] --name=env-entry-name application-name[/module]

DESCRIPTION
       The unset-web-env-entry subcommand unsets an environment entry for one
       of the following items:

       *   A deployed web application

       *   A web module in a deployed Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java
           EE) application

       When an entry is unset, its value reverts to the value, if any, that is
       set in the application's deployment descriptor.

       The application must already be deployed. Otherwise, an error occurs.

       The entry must have previously been set by using the
       set-web-env-entry(1) subcommand. Otherwise, an error occurs.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           Do not use the               |
           |           unset-web-env-entry          |
           |           subcommand to change the     |
           |           value of an environment      |
           |           entry that is set in an      |
           |           application's deployment     |
           |           descriptor. Instead, use the |
           |           set-web-env-entry subcommand |
           |           for this purpose.            |
           +----------------------------------------+

       This subcommand enables you to change the configuration of a deployed
       application without the need to modify the application's deployment
       descriptors and repackage and redeploy the application.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --name
           The name of the environment entry that is to be unset. The name is
           a JNDI name relative to the java:comp/env context. The name must be
           unique within a deployment component. This entry must have
           previously been set by using the set-web-env-entry subcommand.
           Otherwise, an error occurs.

OPERANDS
       application-name
           The name of the application. This name can be obtained from the
           Administration Console or by using the list-applications(1)
           subcommand.

           The application must already be deployed. Otherwise, an error
           occurs.

       module
           The relative path to the module within the application's enterprise
           archive (EAR) file. The path to the module is specified in the
           module element of the application's application.xml file.

           module is required only if the environment entry applies to a web
           module of a Java EE application. If specified, module must follow
           application-name, separated by a slash (/).

           For example, the application.xml file for the myApp application
           might specify the following web module:

               <module>
                   <web>
                       <web-uri>myWebModule.war</web-uri>
                   </web>
               </module>
           The module would be specified as the operand of this command as
           myApp/myWebModule.war.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Unsetting an Environment Entry for a Web Application

           application hello. The entry reverts to the value, if any, that is
           defined in the application's deployment descriptor.
