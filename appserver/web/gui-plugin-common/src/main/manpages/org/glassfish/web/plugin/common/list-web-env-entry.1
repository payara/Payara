list-web-env-entry(1)     asadmin Utility Subcommands    list-web-env-entry(1)

NAME
       list-web-env-entry - lists environment entries for a deployed web
       application or module

SYNOPSIS
           list-web-env-entry [--help] [--name=env-entry-name] application-name[/module]

DESCRIPTION
       The list-web-env-entry subcommand lists the environment entries for one
       of the following items:

       *   A deployed web application

       *   A web module in a deployed Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java
           EE) application

       The application must already be deployed. Otherwise, an error occurs.

       The list-web-env-entry subcommand lists only entries that have
       previously been set by using the set-web-env-entry(1) subcommand. The
       subcommand does not list environment entries that are set only in the
       application's deployment descriptor.

       For each entry, the following information is displayed:

       *   The name of the entry

       *   The Java type of the entry

       *   The value to which the entry is set

       *   The value of the --ignoreDescriptorItem option of the
           set-web-env-entry subcommand that was specified when the entry was
           set

       *   The description of the entry or null if no description was
           specified when the entry was set

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --name
           The name of the environment entry that is to be listed. The name is
           a JNDI name relative to the java:comp/env context. The name must be
           unique within a deployment component. If this option is omitted,
           all environment entries that have previously been set for the
           application are listed.

OPERANDS
       application-name
           The name of the application. This name can be obtained from the
           Administration Console or by using the list-applications(1)
           subcommand.

           The application must already be deployed. Otherwise, an error
           occurs.

       module
           The relative path to the module within the application's enterprise
           archive (EAR) file. The path to the module is specified in the
           module element of the application's application.xml file.

           module is required only if the environment entry applies to a web
           module of a Java EE application. If specified, module must follow
           application-name, separated by a slash (/).

           For example, the application.xml file for the myApp application
           might specify the following web module:

               <module>
                   <web>
                       <web-uri>myWebModule.war</web-uri>
                   </web>
               </module>
           The module would be specified as the operand of this command as
           myApp/myWebModule.war.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Listing Environment Entries for a Web Application
           This example lists all environment entries that have been set for
           the web application hello by using the set-web-env-entry
           subcommand. Because no description was specified when the Hello
           Port environment entry was set, null is displayed instead of a
           description for this entry.

               asadmin> list-web-env-entry hello
               Hello User (java.lang.String) = techscribe ignoreDescriptorItem=false
                //User authentication for Hello appplication
               Hello Port (java.lang.Integer) = null ignoreDescriptorItem=true //null

               Command list-web-env-entry executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
