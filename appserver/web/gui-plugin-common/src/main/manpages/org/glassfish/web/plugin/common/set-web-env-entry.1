set-web-env-entry(1)      asadmin Utility Subcommands     set-web-env-entry(1)

NAME
       set-web-env-entry - sets an environment entry for a deployed web
       application or module

SYNOPSIS
           set-web-env-entry [--help]
           --name=env-entry-name --type=env-entry-type
           {--value=value|--ignoredescriptoritem={true|false}}
           [--description=description] application-name[/module]

DESCRIPTION
       The set-web-env-entry subcommand sets an environment entry for one of
       the following items:

       *   A deployed web application

       *   A web module in a deployed Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java
           EE) application

       The application must already be deployed. Otherwise, an error occurs.

       An application uses the values of environment entries to customize its
       behavior or presentation.

       This subcommand enables you to change the configuration of a deployed
       application without the need to modify the application's deployment
       descriptors and repackage and redeploy the application.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --name
           The name of the environment entry that is to be set. The name is a
           JNDI name relative to the java:comp/env context. The name must be
           unique within a deployment component.

       --type
           The fully-qualified Java type of the environment entry value that
           is expected by the application's code. This type must be one of the
           following Java types:

           *   java.lang.Boolean

           *   java.lang.Byte

           *   java.lang.Character

           *   java.lang.Double

           *   java.lang.Float

           *   java.lang.Integer

           *   java.lang.Long

           *   java.lang.Short

           *   java.lang.String

       --value
           The value to which the environment entry is to be set. If the
           --type is java.lang.Character, the value must be a single
           character. Otherwise, the value must be a string that is valid for
           the constructor of the specified type.

           Either the --value option or the --ignoredescriptoritem option must
           be set.

       --ignoredescriptoritem
           Specifies whether the environment entry is ignored if it is set in
           the application's deployment descriptor. When an environment entry
           is ignored, the application behaves as if the entry had never been
           set in the application's deployment descriptor. The behavior of an
           application in this situation depends on the application.

           The possible values are as follows:

           false
               The value is not ignored (default).

           true
               The value is ignored.

           Either the --value option or the --ignoredescriptoritem option must
           be set.

               Note
               +----------------------------------------+
               |Do not use the --ignoredescriptoritem   |
               |option to unset an environment entry    |
               |that has previously been set by using   |
               |the set-web-env-entry subcommand.       |
               |Instead, use the unset-web-env-entry(1) |
               |subcommand for this purpose.            |
               +----------------------------------------+

       --description
           An optional textual description of the environment entry that is
           being set.

OPERANDS
       application-name
           The name of the application. This name can be obtained from the
           Administration Console or by using the list-applications(1)
           subcommand.

           The application must already be deployed. Otherwise, an error
           occurs.

       module
           The relative path to the module within the application's enterprise
           archive (EAR) file. The path to the module is specified in the
           module element of the application's application.xml file.

           module is required only if the environment entry applies to a web
           module of a Java EE application. If specified, module must follow
           application-name, separated by a slash (/).

           For example, the application.xml file for the myApp application
           might specify the following web module:

               <module>
                   <web>
                       <web-uri>myWebModule.war</web-uri>
                   </web>
               </module>
           The module would be specified as the operand of this command as
           myApp/myWebModule.war.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Setting an Environment Entry for a Web Application
           This example sets the environment entry Hello User of the
           application hello to techscribe. The Java type of this entry is
           java.lang.String.

               asadmin> set-web-env-entry --name="Hello User"
               --type=java.lang.String --value=techscribe
               --description="User authentication for Hello appplication" hello

               Command set-web-env-entry executed successfully.

       Example 2, Ignoring an Environment Entry That Is Defined in a
       Deployment Descriptor
           This example ignores the environment entry Hello Port of the web
           application hello.

               asadmin> set-web-env-entry --name="Hello Port"
               --type=java.lang.Integer --ignoredescriptoritem=true hello

               Command set-web-env-entry executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
