list-web-context-param(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands  list-web-context-param(1)

NAME
       list-web-context-param - lists servlet context-initialization
       parameters of a deployed web application or module

SYNOPSIS
           list-web-context-param [--help]
           [--name=context-param-name] application-name[/module]

DESCRIPTION
       The list-web-context-param subcommand lists the servlet
       context-initialization parameters of one of the following items:

       *   A deployed web application

       *   A web module in a deployed Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java
           EE) application

       The application must already be deployed. Otherwise, an error occurs.

       The list-web-context-param subcommand lists only parameters that have
       previously been set by using the set-web-context-param(1) subcommand.
       The subcommand does not list parameters that are set only in the
       application's deployment descriptor.

       For each parameter, the following information is displayed:

       *   The name of the parameter

       *   The value to which the parameter is set

       *   The value of the --ignoreDescriptorItem option of the
           set-web-context-param subcommand that was specified when the
           parameter was set

       *   The description of the parameter or null if no description was
           specified when the parameter was set

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --name
           The name of the servlet context-initialization parameter that is to
           be listed. If this option is omitted, all parameters of the
           application that have previously been set are listed.

OPERANDS
       application-name
           The name of the application. This name can be obtained from the
           Administration Console or by using the list-applications(1)
           subcommand.

           The application must already be deployed. Otherwise, an error
           occurs.

       module
           The relative path to the module within the application's enterprise
           archive (EAR) file. The path to the module is specified in the
           module element of the application's application.xml file.

           module is required only if the servlet context-initialization
           parameter applies to a web module of a Java EE application. If
           specified, module must follow application-name, separated by a
           slash (/).

           For example, the application.xml file for the myApp application
           might specify the following web module:

               <module>
                   <web>
                       <web-uri>myWebModule.war</web-uri>
                   </web>
               </module>
           The module would be specified as the operand of this command as
           myApp/myWebModule.war.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Listing Servlet Context-Initialization Parameters for a Web
       Application
           This example lists all servlet context-initialization parameters of
           the web application basic-ezcomp that have been set by using the
           set-web-context-param subcommand. Because no description was
           specified when the javax.faces.PROJECT_STAGE parameter was set,
           null is displayed instead of a description for this parameter.

               asadmin> list-web-context-param basic-ezcomp
               javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD = client ignoreDescriptorItem=false
               //The location where the application's state is preserved
               javax.faces.PROJECT_STAGE = null ignoreDescriptorItem=true //null

               Command list-web-context-param executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
