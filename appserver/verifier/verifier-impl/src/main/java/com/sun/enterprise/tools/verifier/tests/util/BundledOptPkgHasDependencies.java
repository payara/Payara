 * Only Jar format files containing class files or resources to be loaded directly 
 * by a standard ClassLoader should be the target of a Class-Path reference; 
 * such files are always named with a .jar extension. 
 * Top level Jar files that are processed by a deployment tool 
 * should not contain Class-Path entries; 
 * such entries would, by definition, 
 * reference other files external to the deployment unit. 
 * A deployment tool is not required to process such external references.
