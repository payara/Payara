/**
 * Added to methods at runtime in case they are affected by one of the FT annotations.
 * This means a FT annotation is either present directly on the method or on the class declaring the method.
 * 
 * This indirection is needed for two reasons:
 * 
 * 1) Allow to process all FT annotations with a single interceptor
 * 
 * 2) Allow to process {@link Fallback} even though it cannot be annotated on type level what would be needed to bind it
 *    to an interceptor directly.
