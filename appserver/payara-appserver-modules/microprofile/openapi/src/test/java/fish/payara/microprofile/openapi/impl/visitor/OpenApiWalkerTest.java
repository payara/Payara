     * When the OpenAPI schema is created, a lot of lookups of classes included in the schema are made.
     * Therefore, it is required to keep to asymptotic complexity as low as possible. Keeping the classes
     * sorted in a TreeSet ensures O(log(n)) complexity, as the tree is re-built on insert.
     * <p>
     * Inside the Set (the internal contract defined by a private field is Set, not TreeSet), regardless
     * of the actual implementation used, all the inserted classes should be foundable afterwards.
     * <p>
     * This method tests a fix for issue {@link https://github.com/payara/Payara/issues/4489}, which pointed out
     * the original custom TreeSet comparator did a reduction to the space of possible classes on lookup, making
     * it impossible for a large subset of classes to be found, even if present in the TreeSet.
     * <p>
     * The compared objects inside the internal comparator supplied to the Set implementation are of type "Class".
     * And classes have no natural distinct ordinal numbers in Java. One way to get an ordinal number for a Class is
     * to use it's fully qualified name and compare the distance to the other compared class in the space consisting
     * of other class names. This way, "more similar" strings have closer cartesian distance. And as String
     * representation of a Classs is used, fast lookup is ensured.
