DESCRIPTION
       The create-managed-thread-factory subcommand creates a managed thread
       factory resource.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --enabled
           Determines whether the managed thread factory is enabled at
           runtime. The default value is true.

       --contextinfoenabled
           Determines whether container contexts are propagated to threads. If
           set to true, the contexts specified in the --contextinfo option are
           propagated. If set to false, no contexts are propagated and the
           --contextinfo option is ignored. The default value is true.

       --contextinfo
           Specifies individual container contexts to propagate to threads.
           Valid values are Classloader, JNDI, Security, and WorkArea. Values
           are specified in a comma-separated list and are case-insensitive.
           All contexts are propagated by default.

       --threadpriority
           Specifies the priority to assign to created threads. The default
           value is 5.

       --usevirtualthreads
           If enabled, virtual threads will be used instead of the default platform
           thread pool. They provide quick creation, minimal overhead, and
           fast thread switching, but are executed on limited "carrying threads".
           Use virtual threads for tasks which depend on external resources
           like databases, micro-services, etc. Do not use them for long
           calculation. 
           The default value is false.

       --description
           Descriptive details about the resource.

       --property
           Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the resource.

           GlassFish Server does not define any additional properties for this
           resource. Moreover, this resource does not currently use any
           additional properties.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which you are creating the resource. Valid
           targets are:

           server
               Creates the resource for the default server instance. This is
               the default value.

           domain
               Creates the resource for the domain.

           instance_name
               Creates the resource for the specified server instance.

OPERANDS
       jndi_name
           The JNDI name of this resource.
