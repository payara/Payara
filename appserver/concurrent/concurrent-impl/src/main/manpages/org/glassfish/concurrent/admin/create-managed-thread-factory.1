DESCRIPTION
       The create-managed-thread-factory subcommand creates a managed thread
       factory resource.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --enabled
           Determines whether the managed thread factory is enabled at
           runtime. The default value is true.

       --contextinfoenabled
           Determines whether container contexts are propagated to threads. If
           set to true, the contexts specified in the --contextinfo option are
           propagated. If set to false, no contexts are propagated and the
           --contextinfo option is ignored. The default value is true.

       --contextinfo
           Specifies individual container contexts to propagate to threads.
           Valid values are Classloader, JNDI, Security, and WorkArea. Values
           are specified in a comma-separated list and are case-insensitive.
           All contexts are propagated by default.

       --threadpriority
           Specifies the priority to assign to created threads. The default
           value is 5.

       --description
           Descriptive details about the resource.

       --property
           Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the resource.

           GlassFish Server does not define any additional properties for this
           resource. Moreover, this resource does not currently use any
           additional properties.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which you are creating the resource. Valid
           targets are:

           server
               Creates the resource for the default server instance. This is
               the default value.

               Creates the resource for the domain.

           cluster_name

               cluster.

           instance_name
               Creates the resource for the specified server instance.
