DESCRIPTION
       The create-managed-executor-service subcommand creates a managed
       executor service resource.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --enabled
           Determines whether the resource is enabled at runtime. The default
           value is true.

       --contextinfoenabled
           Determines whether container contexts are propagated to threads. If
           set to true, the contexts specified in the --contextinfo option are
           propagated. If set to false, no contexts are propagated and the
           --contextinfo option is ignored. The default value is true.

       --contextinfo
           Specifies individual container contexts to propagate to threads.
           Valid values are Classloader, JNDI, Security, and WorkArea. Values
           are specified in a comma-separated list and are case-insensitive.
           All contexts are propagated by default.

       --threadpriority
           Specifies the priority to assign to created threads. The default
           value is 5.

       --longrunningtasks
           Specifies whether the resource should be used for long-running
           tasks. The default value is false. If set to true, long-running
           tasks are not reported as stuck.

       --hungafterseconds
           Specifies the number of seconds that a task can execute before it
           is considered unresponsive. The default value is 0, which means
           that tasks are never considered unresponsive.

       --corepoolsize
           Specifies the number of threads to keep in a thread pool, even if
           they are idle. The default value is 0.

           When a new task is submitted and the number of running threads is
           less than corepoolsize, a new thread is created to handle the
           request. When the value for corepoolsize is 0 (the default), new
           threads are never created unless the task queue is full or the
           resource is using direct queuing. Direct queuing occurs when
           taskqueuecapacity is 0, or when taskqueuecapacity is 2147483647 and
           corepoolsize is 0.

       --maximumpoolsize
           Specifies the maximum number of threads that a thread pool can
           contain. The default value is 2147483647, which means that the
           thread pool is essentially unbounded and can contain any number of
           threads.

       --keepaliveseconds
           Specifies the number of seconds that threads can remain idle when
           the number of threads is greater than corepoolsize. The default
           value is 60.

       --threadlifetimeseconds
           Specifies the number of seconds that threads can remain in a thread
           pool before being purged, regardless of whether the number of
           threads is greater than corepoolsize or whether the threads are
           idle. The default value is 0, which means that threads are never
           purged.

       --taskqueuecapacity
           Specifies the number of submitted tasks that can be stored in the
           task queue awaiting execution. The default value is 2147483647,
           which means that the task queue is essentially unbounded and can
           store any number of submitted tasks.

       --description
           Descriptive details about the resource.

       --property
           Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the resource.

           GlassFish Server does not define any additional properties for this
           resource. Moreover, this resource does not currently use any
           additional properties.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which you are creating the resource. Valid
           targets are:

           server
               Creates the resource for the default server instance. This is
               the default value.

           domain
               Creates the resource for the domain.

           cluster_name
               Creates the resource for every server instance in the specified
               cluster.

           instance_name
               Creates the resource for the specified server instance.

OPERANDS
       jndi_name
           The JNDI name of this resource.
