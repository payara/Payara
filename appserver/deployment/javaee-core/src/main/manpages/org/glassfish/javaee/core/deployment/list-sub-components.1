NAME
       list-sub-components - lists EJB or servlet components in a deployed
       module or module of a deployed application

SYNOPSIS
           list-sub-components [--help] [--type type]
           [--appname appname] [--resources]
           modulename

DESCRIPTION
       The list-sub-components subcommand lists EJB or servlet components in a
       deployed module or in a module of a deployed application. If a module
       is not specified, all modules are listed. The --appname option
       functions only when the specified module is stand-alone. To display a
       specific module in an application, you must specify the module name
       with the --appname option.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --type
           Specifies the type of component to be listed. The options are ejbs
           and servlets. If nothing is specified, then all of the components
           are listed.

       --appname
           Identifies the name of the application. This option is required
           when the desired output is the subcomponents of an embedded module
           of a deployed application.

           The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows
           the name and is separated from the name by a colon (:). The version
           identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain
           alphanumeric characters plus underscore (_), dash (-), and period
           (.) characters. For more information about module and application
           versions, see "Module and Application Versions" in Oracle GlassFish
           Server Application Deployment Guide.

       --resources
           Lists the application-scoped resources for each subcomponent.

OPERANDS
       modulename
           Specifies the name of the module containing the subcomponent.

           The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows
           the name and is separated from the name by a colon (:). The version
           identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain
           alphanumeric characters plus underscore (_), dash (-), and period
           (.) characters. For more information about module and application
           versions, see "Module and Application Versions" in Oracle GlassFish
           Server Application Deployment Guide.
