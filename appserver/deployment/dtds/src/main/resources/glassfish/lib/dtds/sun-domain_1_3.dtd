        automatically generates; it doesnt affect the URLs for        
        directories and files stored in the server. This name should  
        be the alias name if your server uses an alias. If you append 
        a colon and port number, that port will be used in URLs the   
        server sends to the client.

        The Servlet 2.4 spec defines a special X-Powered-By:          
        Servlet/2.4 header, which containers may add to               
        servlet-generated responses. This is complemented by the JSP  
        2.0 spec, which defines a X-Powered-By: JSP/2.0 header to be  
        added (on an optional basis) to responses utilizing JSP       
        technology. The goal of these headers is to aid in gathering  
        statistical data about the use of Servlet and JSP technology. 
        If true, these headers will be added.

<!-- virtual-server
    Configuration of Virtual Server                                   

    Virtualization in Application Server allows multiple URL domains to be     
    served by the same HTTP server process, which is listening on multiple     
    host addresses If an application is available at two virtual servers, they 
    still share same physical resource pools, such as JDBC connection pools.   

    Sun ONE Application Server allows a list of virtual servers, to be         
    specified along with web-module and j2ee-application elements. This        
    establishes an association between URL domains, represented by the virtual 
    server and the web modules (standalone web modules or web modules inside   
    the ear file)

        The ejb-timer-service element contains the configuration for  
        the ejb timer service. There is at most one ejb timer service 
        per server instance.                                          

  attributes

        (eb, sfsb) specifies the rate at which the cache cleaner      
        thread is scheduled. All idle instances are passivated at     
        once.                                                         
    cache-resize-quantity                                                      
        (eb,sfsb) Cache elements have identity, hence growth is in    
        unit steps and created on demand. Shrinking of cache happens  

        when cache-idle-timeout-in-seconds timer expires and a cleaner thread  
        passivates beans which have been idle for longer than                  
        cache-idle-timeout-in-seconds. All idle instances are passivated at    
        once. cache-resize-quantity does not apply in this case.               

        when max cache size is reached, an asynchronous task is created to     
        bring the size back under the max-cache-size limit. This task removes  
        cache-resize-quantity elements, consulting the victim-selection-policy.

        Must be greater than 1 and less than max-cache-size.                   

    commit-option                                                              
        (eb) Entity Beans caching is controlled by this setting.      
        Commit Option C implies that no caching is performed in the   
        container.

        (sfsb,eb) specifies the maximum number of instances that can  
        be cached. For entity beans, internally two caches are        
        maintained for higher concurrency: (i) Ready (R$) (ii) Active 
        in an Incomplete Transaction (TX$). The TX$ is populated with 
        instances from R$ or from the Pool directly. When an instance 
        in TX$ completes the transaction, it is placed back in the R$ 
        (or in pool, in case an instance with same identity already   
        is in R$). max-cache-size only specifies the upper limit for  
        R$. The container computes an appropriate size for TX$. For   
        SFSBs, after the max-cache-size is reached, beans (as         
        determined by the victim-selection-policy) get passivated.    
    max-pool-size                                                              
        (slsb,eb) maximum size, a pool can grow to. A value of 0      
        implies an unbounded pool. Unbounded pools eventually shrink  
        to the steady-pool-size, in steps defined by                  
        pool-resize-quantity.                                         
    pool-idle-timeout-in-seconds                                               
        (slsb,eb) defines the rate at which the pool cleaning thread  
        is executed. this thread checks if current size is greater    
        than steady pool size, it removes pool-resize-quantity        
        elements. If the current size is less than steady-pool-size   
        it is increased by pool-resize-quantity, with a ceiling of    
        min (current-pool-size + pool-resize-quantity, max-pool-size) 
        Only objects that have not been accessed for more than        
        pool-idle-timeout-in-seconds are candidates for removal.      
    pool-resize-quantity                                                       
        (slsb,eb) size of bean pool grows (shrinks) in steps          
        specified by pool-resize-quantity, subject to max-pool-size   
        (steady-pool-size) limit.                                     
    removal-timeout-in-seconds                                                 
        (sfsb) Instance is removed from cache or passivation store,   
        if it is not accesed within this time. All instances that can 
        be removed, will be removed.                                  
    session-store                                                              
        specifies the directory where passivated beans and persisted  
        HTTP sessions are stored on the file system. Defaults to      
        $INSTANCE-ROOT/session-store                                  
    steady-pool-size                                                           
        (slsb,eb) number of bean instances normally maintained in     
        pool. When a pool is first created, it will be populated with 
        size equal to steady-pool-size. When an instance is removed   
        from the pool, it is replenished asynchronously, so that the  
        pool size is at or above the steady-pool-size. This additions 
        will be in multiples of pool-resize-quantity. When a bean is  
        disassociated from a method invocation, it is put back in the 
        pool, subject to max-pool-size limit. If the max pool size is 
        exceeded the bean id destroyed immediately. A pool cleaning   
        thread, executes at an interval defined by                    
        pool-idle-timeout-in-seconds. This thread reduces the pool    
        size to steady-pool-size, in steps defined by                 
        pool-resize-quantity. If the pool is empty, the required      
        object will be created and returned immediately. This         
        prevents threads from blocking till the pool is replenished   
        by the background thread. steady-pool-size must be greater    
        than 1 and at most equal to the max-pool-size.                
    victim-selection-policy                                                    
        (sfsb) Victim selection policy when cache needs to shrink.    
        Victims are passivated. Entity Bean Victims are selected      
        always using fifo discipline. Does not apply to slsb because  
        it does not matter, which particular instances are removed.   
        fifo                                                                   
            method picks victims, oldest instance first.              
        lru

            policy tries to pick 'not recently used' instances and is

        handlers to log into a different log destination than the     
        default ones given by the system (which are Console, File and 
        Syslog). It is a requirement that customers use the log       
        formatter provided by the the system to maintain uniformity   
        in log messages. The custom log handler will be added at the  
        end of the handler chain after File + Syslog Handler, Console 
        Handler and JMX Handler. User cannot replace the handler      
        provided by the system, because of loosing precious log       
        statements. The Server Initialization will take care of       
        installing the custom handler with the system formatter       
        initialized. The user need to use JSR 047 Log Handler

        This is a new attribute to enable time based log rotation.    
        The Log File will be rotated only if this value is non-zero   
        and the valid range is 60 minutes (1 hour) to 10*24*60        
        minutes (10 days). If the value is zero then the files will

    information needed by the core J2EE security service. Some        
    container-specific security configuration elements are in the     
    various container configuration elements and not here. SSL        
    configuration is also elsewhere. At this time the security        
    service configuration consists of a set of authentication realms. 
    A number of top-level attributes are defined as well.

        During recovery, if outcome of a transaction cannot be        
        determined from the logs, then this property is used to fix   
        the outcome.

        property used to specify the number of transactions between   
        keypoint operations on the log. A Keypoint operations could   
        reduce the size of the transaction log files. A larger value  
        for this property (for example, 1000) will result in larger   
        transaction log files, between log compactions, but less      
        keypoint operations, and potentially better performance. A    
        smaller value (e.g. 20) results in smaller log files but      
        slightly reduced performance due to the greater frequency of  
        keypoint operations.                                          
    retry-timeout-in-seconds                                                   
        used to determine the retry time in the following scenarios.  

        1 Time to wait at the transaction recovery time, when
            resources are unreachable.
        2 If there are any transient
            exceptions in the second phase of the 2 PC protocol.

        A negative value indicates infinite retry. '0' indicates no   
        retry. A positive value indicates the number of seconds for   
        which retry will be attempted. Default is 10 minutes which    
        may be appropriate for a database being restarted.

        amount of time the transaction manager waits for response     
        from a datasource participating in transaction. A value of 0  
        implies infinite timeout.

        Transaction service creates a sub directory 'tx' under        
        tx-log-dir to store the transaction logs. The default value   
        of the tx-log-dir is $INSTANCE-ROOT/logs. If this attribute   
        is not explicitly specified in the <transaction-service>

<!-- group-management-service
    group-management-service(GMS) is an in-process service that       
    provides cluster monitoring and group communication services. GMS 
    notifies registered modules in an application server instance     
    when one or more members in the cluster fail (become              
    unreachable). GMS also provides the ability to send and receive   
    messages between a group of processes. GMS is a abstraction layer 
    that plugs-in group communication technologies which rely on a    
    configurable stack of protocols. Each of these protocols has      
    properties that can be changed for a given network and deployment 
    topology. These relevant configurable protocols are: fd-protocol  
    enables its members to periodically monitor other group members   
    to determine their availability in the group. merge-protocol is   
    used to reunite subgroups that formed as a result of a network    
    partition after such a partition has healed. ping-protocol is     
    used for discovery of the group and its members. vs-protocol      
    verifies suspect instances by adding a verification layer to mark 
    a failure suspicion as a confirmed failure.

  attributes
    allow-non-component-callers                                                
        A pool with this property set to true, can be used by         
        non-J2EE components (i.e components other than EJBs or        
        Servlets). The returned connection is enlisted automatically  
        with the transaction context obtained from the transaction    
        manager. This property is to enable the pool to be used by    
        non-component callers such as ServletFilters, Lifecycle       
        modules, and 3rd party persistence managers. Standard J2EE    
        components can continue to use such pools. Connections        
        obtained by non-component callers are not automatically       
        cleaned at the end of a transaction by the container. They    
        need to be explicitly closed by the the caller.               
    associate-with-thread                                                      
        Associate a connection with the thread such that when the     
        same thread is in need of a connection, it can reuse the      
        connection already associated with that thread, thereby not   
        incurring the overhead of getting a connection from the pool. 
        Default value is false.                                       
    connection-creation-retry-attempts                                         
        The number of attempts to create a new connection. Default is 
        0, which implies no retries.                                  
    connection-creation-retry-interval-in-seconds                              
        The time interval between retries while attempting to create  
        a connection. Default is 10 seconds. Effective when           
        connection-creation-retry-attempts is greater than 0.         
    connection-leak-reclaim                                                    
        If enabled, connection will be reusable (put back into pool)  
        after connection-leak-timeout-in-seconds occurs. Default      
        value is false.                                               
    connection-leak-timeout-in-seconds                                         
        To aid user in detecting potential connection leaks by the    
        application. When a connection is not returned back to the    
        pool by the application within the specified period, it is    
        assumed to be a potential leak and stack trace of the caller  
        will be logged. Default is 0, which implies there is no leak  
        detection, by default. A positive non-zero value turns on     
        leak detection. Note however that, this attribute only        
        detects if there is a connection leak. The connection can be  
        reclaimed only if connection-leak-reclaim is set to true.     
    connection-validation-method                                               
        specifies the type of validation to be performed when         
        is-connection-validation-required is true. The following      
        types of validation are supported:                            
        auto-commit                                                            
            using connection.autoCommit()                             
        meta-data                                                              
            using connection.getMetaData()                            
        table                                                                  
            performing a query on a user specified table (see         
            validation-table-name).                                   
    datasource-classname                                                       
        Name of the vendor supplied JDBC datasource resource manager. 
        An XA or global transactions capable datasource class will    
        implement javax.sql.XADatasource interface. Non XA or Local   
        transactions only datasources will implement                  
        javax.sql.Datasource interface.                               
    fail-all-connections                                                       
        indicates if all connections in the pool must be closed       
        should a single validation check fail. The default is false.  
        One attempt will be made to re-establish failed connections.  
    idle-timeout-in-seconds                                                    
        maximum time in seconds, that a connection can remain idle in 
        the pool. After this time, the pool implementation can close  
        this connection. Note that this does not control connection   
        timeouts enforced at the database server side. Adminsitrators 
        are advised to keep this timeout shorter than the database    
        server side timeout (if such timeouts are configured on the   
        specific vendor's database), to prevent accumulation of       
        unusable connection in Application Server.                    
    is-connection-validation-required                                          
        if true, connections are validated (checked to find out if    
        they are usable) before giving out to the application. The    
        default is false.                                             
    is-isolation-level-guaranteed                                              
        Applicable only when a particular isolation level is          
        specified for transaction-isolation-level. The default value  
        is true. This assures that every time a connection is         
        obtained from the pool, it is guaranteed to have the          
        isolation set to the desired value. This could have some      
        performance impact on some JDBC drivers. Can be set to false  
        by that administrator when they are certain that the          
        application does not change the isolation level before        
        returning the connection.                                     
    lazy-connection-association                                                
        Connections are lazily associated when an operation is        
        performed on them. Also, they are disassociated when the      
        transaction is completed and a component method ends, which   
        helps reuse of the physical connections. Default value is     
        false.                                                        
    lazy-connection-enlistment                                                 
        Enlist a resource to the transaction only when it is actually 
        used in a method, which avoids enlistment of connections that 
        are not used in a transaction. This also prevents unnecessary 
        enlistment of connections cached in the calling components.   
        Default value is false.                                       
    match-connections                                                          
        To switch on/off connection matching for the pool. It can be  
        set to false if the administrator knows that the connections  
        in the pool will always be homogeneous and hence a connection 
        picked from the pool need not be matched by the resource      
        adapter. Default value is false.                              
    max-connection-usage-count                                                 
        When specified, connections will be re-used by the pool for   
        the specified number of times after which it will be closed.  
        This is useful for instance, to avoid statement-leaks.        
        Default value is 0, which implies the feature is not enabled. 
    max-pool-size                                                              
        maximum number of conections that can be created              
    max-wait-time-in-millis                                                    
        amount of time the caller will wait before getting a          
        connection timeout. The default is 60 seconds. A value of 0   
        will force caller to wait indefinitely.                       
    name                                                                       
        unique name of the pool definition.                           
    non-transactional-connections                                              
        A pool with this property set to true returns                 
        non-transactional connections. This connection does not get   
        automatically enlisted with the transaction manager.          
    pool-resize-quantity                                                       
        number of connections to be removed when                      
        idle-timeout-in-seconds timer expires. Connections that have  
        idled for longer than the timeout are candidates for removal. 
        When the pool size reaches steady-pool-size, the connection   
        removal stops.                                                
    res-type                                                                   
        DataSource implementation class could implement one of of     
        javax.sql.DataSource, javax.sql.XADataSource or               
        javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource interfaces. This optional  
        attribute must be specified to disambiguate when a Datasource 
        class implements two or more of these interfaces. An error is 
        produced when this attribute has a legal value and the        
        indicated interface is not implemented by the datasource      
        class. This attribute has no default value.                   
    statement-timeout-in-seconds                                               
        Sets the timeout property of a connection to enable           
        termination of abnormally long running queries. Default value 
        of -1 implies that it is not enabled.                         
    steady-pool-size                                                           
        minimum and initial number of connections maintained in the   
        pool.                                                         
    transaction-isolation-level                                                
        Specifies the Transaction Isolation Level on the pooled       
        database connections. Optional. Has no default. If left       
        unspecified the pool operates with default isolation level    
        provided by the JDBC Driver. A desired isolation level can be 
        set using one of the standard transaction isolation levels,   
        which see.                                                    

        Applications that change the Isolation level on a pooled connection    
        programmatically, risk polluting the pool and this could lead to       
        program errors. Also see: is-isolation-level-guaranteed                

    validate-atmost-once-period-in-seconds                                     
        Used to set the time-interval within which a connection is    
        validated atmost once. Default is 0 which implies that it is  
        not enabled. TBD: Documentation is to be corrected.           
    validation-table-name                                                      
        specifies the table name to be used to perform a query to     
        validate a connection. This parameter is mandatory, if        
        connection-validation-type set to table. Verification by      
        accessing a user specified table may become necessary for     
        connection validation, particularly if database driver caches 
        calls to setAutoCommit() and getMetaData().                   
    wrap-jdbc-objects                                                          
        When set to true, application will get wrapped jdbc objects   
        for Statement, PreparedStatement, CallableStatement,          
        ResultSet, DatabaseMetaData. Defaults to false.

<!-- connector-connection-pool
    connector-connection-pool defines configuration used to create    
    and manage a pool of connections to a EIS. Pool definition is     
    named, and can be referred to by multiple connector-resource      
    elements (See connector-resource).                                

    Each named pool definition results in a pool instantiated at server        
    start-up. Pool is populated when accessed for the first time. If two or    
    more connector-resource elements point to the same                         
    connector-connection-pool element, they are using the same pool of         
    connections, at run time.                                                  

    There can be more than one pool for one connection-definition in one       
    resource-adapter.

    connection-creation-retry-attempts                                         
        The number of attempts to create a new connection. Default is 
        0, which implies no retries.                                  
    connection-creation-retry-interval-in-seconds                              
        The time interval between retries while attempting to create  
        a connection. Default is 10 seconds. Effective when           
        connection-creation-retry-attempts is greater than 0.         
    connection-definition-name                                                 
        unique name, identifying one connection-definition in a       
        Resource Adapter. Currently this is ConnectionFactory type.   
    connection-leak-reclaim                                                    
        If enabled, connection will be reusable (put back into pool)  
        after connection-leak-timeout-in-seconds occurs. Default      
        value is false.                                               
    connection-leak-timeout-in-seconds                                         
        To aid user in detecting potential connection leaks by the    
        application. When a connection is not returned back to the    
        pool by the application within the specified period, it is    
        assumed to be a potential leak and stack trace of the caller  
        will be logged. Default is 0, which implies there is no leak  
        detection, by default. A positive non-zero value turns on     
        leak detection. Note however that, this attribute only        
        detects if there is a connection leak. The connection can be  
        reclaimed only if connection-leak-reclaim is set to true.     
    fail-all-connections                                                       
        indicates if all connections in the pool must be closed       
        should a single connection fail validation. The default is    
        false. One attempt will be made to re-establish failed        
        connections.                                                  
    idle-timeout-in-seconds                                                    
        maximum time in seconds, that a connection can remain idle in 
        the pool. After this time, the pool implementation can close  
        this connection. Note that this does not control connection   
        timeouts enforced at the database server side. Adminsitrators 
        are advised to keep this timeout shorter than the EIS         
        connection timeout (if such timeouts are configured on the    
        specific EIS), to prevent accumulation of unusable connection 
        in Application Server.                                        
    is-connection-validation-required                                          
        This attribute specifies if the connection that is about to   
        be returned is to be validated by the container,              
    lazy-connection-association                                                
        Connections are lazily associated when an operation is        
        performed on them. Also, they are disassociated when the      
        transaction is completed and a component method ends, which   
        helps reuse of the physical connections. Default value is     
        false.                                                        
    lazy-connection-enlistment                                                 
        Enlist a resource to the transaction only when it is actually 
        used in a method, which avoids enlistment of connections that 
        are not used in a transaction. This also prevents unnecessary 
        enlistment of connections cached in the calling components.   
        Default value is false.                                       
    match-connections                                                          
        To switch on/off connection matching for the pool. It can be  
        set to false if the administrator knows that the connections  
        in the pool will always be homogeneous and hence a connection 
        picked from the pool need not be matched by the resource      
        adapter. Default value is true.                               
    max-connection-usage-count                                                 
        When specified, connections will be re-used by the pool for   
        the specified number of times after which it will be closed.  
        This is useful for instance, to avoid statement-leaks.        
        Default value is 0, which implies the feature is not enabled. 
    max-pool-size                                                              
        maximum number of conections that can be created              
    max-wait-time-in-millis                                                    
        amount of time the caller will wait before getting a          
        connection timeout. The default is 60 seconds. A value of 0   
        will force caller to wait indefinitely.                       
    name                                                                       
        unique name of the pool definition.                           
    pool-resize-quantity                                                       
        number of connections to be removed when                      
        idle-timeout-in-seconds timer expires. Connections that have  
        idled for longer than the timeout are candidates for removal. 
        When the pool size reaches steady-pool-size, the connection   
        removal stops.                                                
    resource-adapter-name                                                      
        This is the name of resource adapter. Name of .rar file is    
        taken as the unique name for the resource adapter.            
    steady-pool-size                                                           
        minimum and initial number of connections maintained in the   
        pool.                                                         
    transaction-support                                                        
        Indicates the level of transaction support that this pool     
        will have. Possible values are "XATransaction",               
        "LocalTransaction" and "NoTransaction". This attribute will   
        override that transaction support attribute in the Resource   
        Adapter in a downward compatible way, i.e it can support a    
        lower/equal transaction level than specified in the RA, but   
        not a higher level.                                           
    validate-atmost-once-period-in-seconds                                     
        Used to set the time-interval within which a connection is    
        validated atmost once. Default is 0 which implies that it is  
        not enabled. TBD: Documentation is to be corrected.

        Each server instance in a cluster has a weight, which may be  
        used to represent the relative processing capacity of that    
        instance. Default weight is 100 for every instance. Weighted  
        load balancing policies will use this weight while load       
        balancing requests within the cluster. It is the              
        responsibility of the administrator to set the relative       
        weights correctly, keeping in mind deployed hardware capacity.
