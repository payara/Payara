The sample tests that exceptions are properly propagated through JavaEE service
engine to the JavaEE component that requested for the webservice. Service engine
acts as a consumer in this test.

There is a Calculator web service, deployed as a servlet, with only one 
operation add which throws an exception. This webservice has it's jbi-enabled 
flag as false. Another servlet is deployed which has it's jbi-enabled flag as 
true. This servlet requests for the Calculator webservice and the call goes 
through the service engine. 
Client is a standalone java application which sends request to the servlet 
which inturn calls the calculator webservice.

ant all of this sample does the following : 
 
1. compiles and deploys the web service on application server.

2. compiles and deploys the servlet that requests for above web service,
   deploys a consumer service unit on SOAP Binding

2. runs the client which invokes the servlet.

3. undeploy applications from app server and service assembly deployment from 
   SOAP Binding.
