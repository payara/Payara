= Tests for EJB HTTP Client

The tests can only be executed in profile `payara-server-remote`.
Target domain needs to have invoker enabled by executing `asadmin set-ejb-invoker-configuration --enabled=true`.

Submodules do not have parent relationship to this module, in order to keep classpath clean of any dependencies except for ejb-http-client.
