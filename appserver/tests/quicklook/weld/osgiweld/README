This test is meant to do two things:

1. Verify that the weld-osgi-bundle-glassfish4.jar has been installed and is 
   running in a GlassFish instance.

2. Verify the exported packages in the osgi bundle.  It does this 
   by comparing the exported packages in the running bundle against
   a "golden file" (weld-osgi.properties) that contains the expected
   exported packages for the current release of Weld for GlassFish.

3. Verify that the bundle-symbolic-name is "org.jboss.weld.osgi-bundle".


PREPARING A NEW TEST

When a new Weld GlassFish release is done, the following must be dne:

1. Make sure GlassFish is started with the weld-osgi-bundle running.

2. Use a tool (such as "bnd") to capture the exported packages in the
   weld-osgi-bundle at run time.  It can be found here: 
   http://www.aqute.biz/Code/Download Just execute the 
   bnd.jar (java -jar bnd.jar).

3. Put the captured exported packages information from the output 
   from this tool into the metadata/weld-osgi.properties file.
