There are two scripts here.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Uses build.xml & Filter.java.
This scripts generates master list of message Ids and also check which message Ids has missing diagnostic info. 

How to use?
% ant all -Dglassfish_home=<gf_home> -Doptions=masterId/missingIds

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Uses ruby script missing-msg-id-finder.rb, message-keys-used-checker.rb & message-key-excl.txt.
2.1 missing-msg-id-finder.rb (uses message-key-excl.txt). Searches all LogStrings.properties in (hard-coded) GF v3 src path for
messages with no proper Id. Result is stored in msgs-with-no-ids.txt.

2.2 message-keys-used-checker.rb (uses msgs-with-no-ids.txt). Searches through all Java classes in (hard-coded) GF v3 src path for
the usage of specified message keys. If found (and not logged as FINE, etc. message), reported to stdout.

2.3 message-key-excl.txt contanis exception list which stores message key for which bug is already raised. Once user close the bug,
you must have to update this txt file and run script again for bug verification.

So first you run 2.1, then 2.2, then update the exclude list as you report/solve the issues. Then run them again, etc.

How to use?

% ruby missing-msg-id-finder.rb <glassfish_home>
% ruby message-keys-used-checker.rb <glassfish_home>
