<p>Use the System Properties page to view and manage GlassFish Server properties.</p>
<p>A system property defines a common value for a setting at the server level. You can refer to a system property in an Admin Console text field by enclosing it in a dollar sign and curly braces. For example, to refer to a property named <i>prop-name</i>, you would use the syntax <code>${</code><i>prop-name</i><code>}</code>.</p>
<p>For each property, the System Properties page contains the following information.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the property.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Value</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value of the property.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>An optional description of the property.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A number of system properties are predefined but are not shown on this page.</p>
