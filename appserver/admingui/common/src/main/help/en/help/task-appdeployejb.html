<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the navigation tree, select the Applications node.</p>
<p>The Applications page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Deployed Applications table, click the Deploy button.</p>
<p>The Deploy Applications or Modules page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify the location of the application to deploy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the application is an archive file that resides on or is accessible from the client machine, select the option Packaged File to Be Uploaded to the Server.</p>
<p>The client machine is the host on which you are viewing the Administration Console through a browser.</p>
<p>Click Browse to browse to the file, or type the full path to the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the application is an archive file that resides on the server machine, or is an unpackaged application from an exploded directory, select the option Local Packaged File or Directory That Is Accessible From the GlassFish Server.</p>
<p>The server machine is the host that is running the domain administration server (DAS).</p>
<p>Click Browse Files to browse to a file, or Browse Folders to browse to a directory. Alternatively, type the full path name to the file or directory. Deploying from an exploded directory is for advanced developers and is not recommended for production environments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the Type drop-down list, select EJB Jar.</p>
<p>If you specified either a Packaged File to Be Uploaded to the Server or a Local Packaged File That Is Accessible From the GlassFish Server, the application type is detected automatically. If you specified a Directory That Is Accessible From the GlassFish Server, you must specify the type manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Application Name field, retain the default name, which is the directory name or the prefix of the file name, or type another name.</p>
<p>The default name appears if you chose to upload a file. The application name must be unique.</p>
<p>The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows the name and is separated from the name by a colon (<code>:</code>). The version identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain alphanumeric characters plus underscore (<code>_</code>), dash (<code>-</code>), and period (<code>.</code>) characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Status Enabled checkbox to enable the application.</p>
<p>This option is selected by default. If this option is disabled, the application is unavailable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Availability Enabled checkbox to enable SFSB checkpointing for the application.</p>
<p>If the Enabled checkbox is selected, high-availability is enabled for stateful session bean (SFSB) checkpointing and potentially passivation. If set to false (default) all SFSB checkpointing is disabled for the specified EJB module. If set to true, the specified EJB module is enabled for high-availability. Set this option to true only if high availability is configured and enabled at higher levels, such as the server and container levels.</p>
<p>This option appears if clusters or standalone server instances aside from the default server instance (<code>server</code>) exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Run Verifier checkbox to verify deployment descriptors before deployment.</p>
<p>If this option is selected and if verification fails, deployment is not performed. The verifier examines the structure and content of the deployment descriptors. Verification of large applications is often time-consuming. This option is disabled by default.</p>
<p>Verifier packages must be installed from the Update Tool or a warning is logged and this option is ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Compatibility checkbox to use GlassFish Server v2 JAR visibility requirements for applications instead of the stricter Java EE 6 requirements implemented in GlassFish Server v3 releases, including 4.0.</p>
<p>This option is disabled by default.</p>
<p>The Java EE 6 platform specification imposes stricter requirements than Java EE 5 did on which JAR files can be visible to various modules within an EAR file. In particular, application clients must not have access to EJB JAR files or other JAR files in the EAR file unless references use the standard Java SE mechanisms (extensions, for example) or the Java EE library-directory mechanism. Checking this box removes these Java EE 6 restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Force Redeploy checkbox to force redeployment if the application is already deployed.</p>
<p>If this option is not selected, an attempt to deploy an application that is already deployed results in an error. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Keep State checkbox to retain web sessions, SFSB instances, and persistently created EJB timers between redeployments.</p>
<p>This option is disabled by default. This option is supported only on the default server instance, named <code>server</code>. It is not supported and ignored for any other target.</p>
<p>Some changes to an application between redeployments prevent this feature from working properly. For example, do not change the set of instance variables in the SFSB bean class.</p>
<p>For web applications, this feature is applicable only if in the <code>glassfish-web-app.xml</code> file the <code>persistence-type</code> attribute of the <code>session-manager</code> element is <code>file</code>.</p>
<p>For stateful session bean instances, the persistence type without high availability is set in the server (the SFSB Persistence Type option) and must be set to <code>file</code>, which is the default and recommended value.</p>
<p>If any active web session, SFSB instance, or EJB timer fails to be preserved or restored, <i>none</i> of these will be available when the redeployment is complete. However, the redeployment continues and a warning is logged.</p>
<p>To preserve active state data, GlassFish Server serializes the data and saves it in memory. To restore the data, the class loader of the newly redeployed application deserializes the data that was previously saved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Preserve Application Scoped Resources checkbox to preserve any application-scoped resources and restore them during redeployment.</p>
<p>This option is disabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Deployment Order field, type a number to specify the deployment order of the application.</p>
<p>Applications with a lower number are loaded first at server startup. An application with a deployment order of 102 is loaded before an application with a deployment order of 110. If a deployment order is not specified at the time an application is deployed, the default deployment order of 100 is assigned. If two applications have the same deployment order, the application that was deployed first is loaded first. Specifying a deployment order is useful if the application has dependencies and must be loaded in a certain order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Libraries field, type a comma-separated list of library JAR files specific to this application.</p>
<p>The paths may be absolute or relative. A relative path is relative to <i>domain-dir</i><code>/lib/applibs</code>. If the path is absolute, the path must be accessible to the domain administration server (DAS), which means it must be under <i>domain-dir</i>. The libraries are made available to the application in the order in which they are specified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Description field, type a description for this application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To add target server instances and clusters on which to deploy the module or application, select them from the Available Targets list and use the Add button to move them to the Selected Targets list.</p>
<p>The Target option appears if clusters or standalone server instances aside from the default server instance (<code>server</code>) exist. By default, the module or application is deployed to the default server instance, named <code>server</code>. Use the Add All button to deploy to all targets. Use the Remove and Remove All buttons to remove targets from the Selected Targets list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click OK.</p>
