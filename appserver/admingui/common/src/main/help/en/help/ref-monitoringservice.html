<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>Use the Monitoring Service page to configure monitoring options for individual server components or services.</p>
<p>You must deploy an application, component, or service before you configure monitoring for it.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Service page contains the following options.</p>

<p>If the Monitoring Service Enabled checkbox is selected, monitoring is enabled for the GlassFish Server. This option is enabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Monitoring MBeans</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the Monitoring MBeans Enabled checkbox is selected, all MBeans needed for monitoring are deployed on the GlassFish Server. This option is enabled by default.</p>
<p>If the checkbox is not selected, you cannot view monitoring data in the Administration Console, even if the Monitoring Service checkbox is selected. Instead, you must use the command line to view monitoring data. If you deselect the checkbox, the memory footprint of the GlassFish Server is reduced.</p>
