<h5>Additional Options for a Web Application</h5>
<p>If the application type is Web Application, the following options appear.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Context Root</dt>
<dd>
<p>The path to the application. In the URL of the web application, the context root immediately follows the port number (<code>http://</code><i>host</i><code>:</code><i>port</i><code>/</code><i>context-root</i><code>/...</code>). The context root must start with a forward slash, for example, <code>/hello</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Application Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the application.</p>
<p>The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows the name and is separated from the name by a colon (<code>:</code>). The version identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain alphanumeric characters plus underscore (<code>_</code>), dash (<code>-</code>), and period (<code>.</code>) characters.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Virtual Servers</dt>
<dd>
<p>The virtual servers associated with this application.</p>
<p>The Virtual Servers option appears if only the default server instance, <code>server</code>, exists. If deployment groups or other standalone server instances exist, you can select virtual servers after deployment. Go to the Edit Application page, select the Target tab, and select Manage Virtual Servers for the desired target.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Status</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this option is selected, the application is enabled. This option is selected by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Availability</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the Enabled checkbox is selected, high-availability is enabled for web sessions and for stateful session bean (SFSB) checkpointing and potentially passivation. If set to false (default) all web session saving and SFSB checkpointing is disabled for the specified application, web application, or EJB module. If set to true, the specified application or module is enabled for high-availability. Set this option to true only if high availability is configured and enabled at higher levels, such as the server and container levels.</p>
<p>This option appears if deployment groups or standalone server instances aside from the default server instance (<code>server</code>) exist.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Precompile JSPs</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this option is selected, JavaServer Pages (JSP) files are precompiled. If this option is disabled, JSP files are compiled at runtime when they are first accessed. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Run Verifier</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this option is selected, deployment descriptors are verified before deployment. If verification fails, deployment is not performed. The verifier examines the structure and content of the deployment descriptors. Verification of large applications is often time-consuming. This option is disabled by default.</p>
<p>Verifier packages must be installed from the Update Tool or a warning is logged and this option is ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Force Redeploy</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this option is selected, the application is redeployed if it is already deployed. If this option is not selected, an attempt to deploy an application that is already deployed results in an error. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Keep State</dt>
<dd>
<p>This option controls whether web sessions, SFSB instances, and persistently created EJB timers are retained between redeployments.</p>
<p>This option is disabled by default. This option is supported only on the default server instance, named <code>server</code>. It is not supported and ignored for any other target.</p>
<p>Some changes to an application between redeployments prevent this feature from working properly. For example, do not change the set of instance variables in the SFSB bean class.</p>
<p>For web applications, this feature is applicable only if in the <code>glassfish-web-app.xml</code> file the <code>persistence-type</code> attribute of the <code>session-manager</code> element is <code>file</code>.</p>
<p>For stateful session bean instances, the persistence type without high availability is set in the server (the SFSB Persistence Type option) and must be set to <code>file</code>, which is the default and recommended value.</p>
<p>If any active web session, SFSB instance, or EJB timer fails to be preserved or restored, <i>none</i> of these will be available when the redeployment is complete. However, the redeployment continues and a warning is logged.</p>
<p>To preserve active state data, Payara Server serializes the data and saves it in memory. To restore the data, the class loader of the newly redeployed application deserializes the data that was previously saved.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Preserve Application Scoped Resources</dt>
<dd>
<p>If checked, preserves any application-scoped resources and restores them during redeployment. This option is not checked by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Deployment Order</dt>
<dd>
<p>The deployment order of the application.</p>
<p>Applications with a lower number are loaded first at server startup. An application with a deployment order of 102 is loaded before an application with a deployment order of 110. If a deployment order is not specified at the time an application is deployed, the default deployment order of 100 is assigned. If two applications have the same deployment order, the application that was deployed first is loaded first. Specifying a deployment order is useful if the application has dependencies and must be loaded in a certain order.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Libraries</dt>
<dd>
<p>A comma-separated list of library JAR files specific to this module or application. The paths may be absolute or relative. A relative path is relative to <i>domain-dir</i><code>/lib/applibs</code>. If the path is absolute, the path must be accessible to the domain administration server (DAS), which means it must be under <i>domain-dir</i>. The libraries are made available to the application in the order in which they are specified.</p>

<h5>Additional Options for an Enterprise Application</h5>
<p>If the application type is Enterprise Application, the following options appear.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Application Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the application.</p>
<p>The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows the name and is separated from the name by a colon (<code>:</code>). The version identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain alphanumeric characters plus underscore (<code>_</code>), dash (<code>-</code>), and period (<code>.</code>) characters.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Virtual Servers</dt>

<p>This option appears if deployment groups or standalone server instances aside from the default server instance (<code>server</code>) exist.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Java Web Start</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this option is selected, Java Web Start access is permitted for an application client module. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Precompile JSPs</dt>

<p>Verifier packages must be installed from the Update Tool or a warning is logged and this option is ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Compatibility</dt>
<dd>
<p>If checked, uses Payara Server v2 JAR visibility requirements for applications instead of the stricter Java EE 6 requirements implemented in Payara Server v3 releases, including 4.0. This option is not checked by default.</p>
<p>The Java EE 6 platform specification imposes stricter requirements than Java EE 5 did on which JAR files can be visible to various modules within an EAR file. In particular, application clients must not have access to EJB JAR files or other JAR files in the EAR file unless references use the standard Java SE mechanisms (extensions, for example) or the Java EE library-directory mechanism. Checking this box removes these Java EE 6 restrictions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Force Redeploy</dt>

<p>This option is disabled by default. This option is supported only on the default server instance, named <code>server</code>. It is not supported and ignored for any other target.</p>
<p>Some changes to an application between redeployments prevent this feature from working properly. For example, do not change the set of instance variables in the SFSB bean class.</p>
<p>For web applications, this feature is applicable only if in the <code>glassfish-web-app.xml</code> file the <code>persistence-type</code> attribute of the <code>session-manager</code> element is <code>file</code>.</p>
<p>For stateful session bean instances, the persistence type without high availability is set in the server (the SFSB Persistence Type option) and must be set to <code>file</code>, which is the default and recommended value.</p>
<p>If any active web session, SFSB instance, or EJB timer fails to be preserved or restored, <i>none</i> of these will be available when the redeployment is complete. However, the redeployment continues and a warning is logged.</p>
<p>To preserve active state data, Payara Server serializes the data and saves it in memory. To restore the data, the class loader of the newly redeployed application deserializes the data that was previously saved.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Deployment Order</dt>
<dd>
<p>The deployment order of the application.</p>
<p>Applications with a lower number are loaded first at server startup. An application with a deployment order of 102 is loaded before an application with a deployment order of 110. If a deployment order is not specified at the time an application is deployed, the default deployment order of 100 is assigned. If two applications have the same deployment order, the application that was deployed first is loaded first. Specifying a deployment order is useful if the application has dependencies and must be loaded in a certain order.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Libraries</dt>
<dd>
<p>A comma-separated list of library JAR files specific to this module or application. Specifies an absolute or relative path. A relative path is relative to <i>domain-dir</i><code>/lib/applibs</code>. If the path is absolute, the path must be accessible to the domain administration server (DAS), which means it must be under <i>domain-dir</i>. The libraries are made available to the application in the order in which they are specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>A description of the application.</p>
