<p>With the <code>certificate</code> realm, Java containers handle authorization processing based on each user's Distinguished Name (DN) from his or her certificate. The DN is the name of the entity whose public key the certificate identifies. This name uses the X.500 standard, so it is intended to be unique across the Internet.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html</a></code>).</p>
