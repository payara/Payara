<h4><a id="sthref189" name="sthref189"></a>JVM Path Settings</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>Use the JVM Path settings page to configure the native library path. The native library path is a concatenation of the following paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The native library path prefix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server's path for its native libraries (that is, <i>as-install</i><code>/lib</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 64-bit native library directories, if applicable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of the <code>java.library.path</code> variable for the JVM used to start the Payara Server (this differs between operating systems)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The native library path suffix</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other settings are shown as read-only values for domains that have been upgraded from an earlier release of Payara Server. They are not supported in the v3 release.</p>
<p>The JVM Path Settings page contains the following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Configuration Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the configuration to which the settings on this page apply. This field is read only.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Environment Classpath</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the Ignore checkbox is selected, the <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable is ignored. The <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable is convenient for basic tutorials in programming, but is not recommended for enterprise environments. This is a read-only field.</p>
</dd>
<dt>System Classpath</dt>
<dd>
<p>The path to the classes on your system. This is a read-only field.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Classpath Prefix</dt>
<dd>
<p>Full paths to the JAR files to be prepended to the server's classpath, one per line. This is a read-only field.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Classpath Suffix</dt>
<dd>
<p>Full paths to the JAR files to be appended to the server's classpath, one per line. This is a read-only field.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Native Library Path Prefix</dt>
<dd>
<p>Full paths to the JAR files to be prepended to the native library path, one per line.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Native Library Path Suffix</dt>
<dd>
<p>Full paths to the JAR files to be appended to the native library path, one per line.</p>
</dd>
