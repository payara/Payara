<a name="task-appdeployruby"></a><h4>To Deploy a Ruby Application</h4><a name="indexterm-46"></a><a name="indexterm-47"></a><a name="indexterm-48"></a><ol>
<li><b>In the navigation tree, select the Applications node.</b><p>The Applications page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Deployed Applications table, click the Deploy button.</b><p>The Deploy Applications or Modules page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>Specify the location of the application to deploy.</b><ul>
<li><b>If the application is an archive file that resides on or is
accessible from the client machine, select the option Packaged File to Be Uploaded
to the Server.</b><p>The client machine is the host on which you are viewing the Administration
Console through a browser.</p><p>Click Browse to browse to the file, or type the full path
to the file.</p></li>
<li><b>If the application is an archive file that resides on the server machine,
or is an unpackaged application from an exploded directory, select the option Local
Packaged File or Directory That Is Accessible From the GlassFish Server.</b><p>The server machine is the host that is running the domain administration server
(DAS). </p><p>Click Browse Files to browse to a file, or Browse Folders to
browse to a directory. Alternatively, type the full path name to the file
or directory. It is common to deploy a JRuby application from a directory.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><b>From the Type drop-down list, select Ruby Application.</b><p>If you specified either a Packaged File to Be Uploaded to the Server
or a Local Packaged File That Is Accessible From the GlassFish Server, the
application type is detected automatically. If you specified a Directory That Is Accessible From
the GlassFish Server, you must specify the type manually.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Application Name field, retain the default name, which is the directory
name or the prefix of the file name, or type another name.</b><p>The default name appears if you chose to upload a file. The
application name must be unique.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Context Root field, type a string that identifies the Ruby application.</b><p>In the URL of the Ruby application, the context root immediately follows the
port number (<tt>http://</tt><i>host</i><tt>:</tt><i>port</i><tt>/</tt><i>context-root</i><tt>/...</tt>). The context root must start with a forward slash, for
example, <tt>/hello</tt>.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Status Enabled checkbox to enable the application.</b><p>This option is selected by default. If this option is disabled, the application
is unavailable.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Force Redeploy checkbox to force redeployment if the application is already
deployed.</b><p>If this option is not selected, an attempt to deploy an application that
is already deployed results in an error. This option is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>In the JRuby Home field, type the path to the directory where the
JRuby container is installed.</b><p>The default location is <tt></tt><i>as-install</i><tt>/jruby</tt>. If you specify a value for this
field, the application value overrides the JRuby Home value set for the Ruby
container.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Initial Pool Size field, type the initial number of JRuby runtimes
to start.</b><p>The value must be greater than or equal to the value in the
Minimum Pool Size field and less than or equal to the value in
the Maximum Pool Size field. The default value is 1. If you
specify a value for this field, the application value overrides the Initial Pool
Size value set for the Ruby container.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Minimum Pool Size field, type the minimum number of JRuby runtimes
in the pool.</b><p>The value must be less than or equal to the value in the
Initial Pool Size field and less than or equal to the value in
the Maximum Pool Size field. The default value is 1. If you
specify a value for this field, the application value overrides the Minimum Pool
Size value set for the Ruby container.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Maximum Pool Size field, type the maximum number of JRuby runtimes
in the pool.</b><p>The value must be greater than or equal to the value in the
Minimum Pool Size field and greater than or equal to the value in
the Initial Pool Size field. The default value is 1. If you
specify a value for this field, the application value overrides the Maximum Pool
Size value set for the Ruby container.</p></li>
<li><b>From the Framework drop-down list, select the framework on which the application is
to be deployed.</b><p>Available choices are <tt>rails</tt>, <tt>merb</tt>, <tt>sinatra</tt>, and <tt>auto-detection</tt>. The default is <tt>auto-detection</tt>.
Setting this property to a value other than <tt>auto-detection</tt> bypasses the normal, and potentially
lengthy, auto-detection process and forces deployment on the specified framework. If the deployed
application is not written for the specified framework, errors result.</p></li>
<li><b>From the Rack Environment drop-down list, select the environment in which the JRuby
framework, such as Rails or Merb, runs.</b><p>Available choices are <tt>production</tt>, <tt>development</tt>, and <tt>test</tt>. The default is <tt>development</tt>.</p></li>
<li><b>From the MT-Safe drop-down list, select the thread-safe setting for the framework in
which the application will run.</b><p>This property affects applications started using an auto-detected user-provided startup script. Available choices are:</p><dl><dt><tt>true</tt></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies that the framework is thread-safe and therefore does not need a pool created for it.</p>

</dd>
<dt><tt>false</tt></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies that the application starts with a pool of application instances, and each instance of the application is accessed by one thread at a time.</p>

</dd>
<dt><tt>default</tt></dt>
<dd><p>The GlassFish Server tries to detect thread safety automatically. This value is the default.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This property only affects frameworks being launched where the thread safety cannot be
automatically determined. Setting this value to <tt>true</tt> does not cause an auto-detected Rails
2.1.<i>x</i> application to be launched in thread-safe mode, nor can it be used
to force a thread-safe framework to start in pooled mode.</p></li>
<li><b>From the Virtual Servers drop-down list, select the virtual server to be associated
with this application.</b></li>
<li><b>In the Description field, type a description for this application.</b></li>
<li><b>Click OK.</b></li></ol><h6>See Also</h6>
