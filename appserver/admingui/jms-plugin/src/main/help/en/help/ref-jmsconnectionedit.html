<h4><a id="sthref53" name="sthref53"></a><a id="sthref54" name="sthref54"></a>Edit JMS Connection Factory</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>Use the Edit JMS Connection Factory page to modify the settings for a JMS connection factory.</p>
<p>The Edit JMS Connection Factory page contains the following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Load Defaults</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to restore settings that have default values to their default values. Settings that do not have default values are not changed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>JNDI Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>A unique JNDI name that identifies the resource. By convention, the name begins with a resource-type indicator and a slash, such as concurrent/, jdbc/, or jms/. The JNDI name is a read-only field. You can only specify the JNDI name when you create a new resource</p>
</dd>
<dt>Logical JNDI Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The logical JNDI name for the resource. It is a Java EE standard name by which the resource can be accessed. The logical JNDI name is a read-only field. See <a href="../../../common/en/help/ref-logicaljndinames.html">Logical JNDI Names</a> for more information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Resource Type</dt>
<dd>
<p>The type of the connection factory. The resource type is a read-only field. You can only specify the resource type when you create a new JMS connection factory.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>A description of the connection factory.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Status</dt>
<dd>
<p>Whether the resource is available at runtime.</p>
<p>If only the default server instance, <code>server</code>, exists in the domain, the resource's runtime availability can be enabled or disabled. Runtime availability is enabled by default.</p>
<p>If any clusters or standalone instances have been created in the domain, use the Target tab to control runtime availability of the resource on its targets.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Initial and Minimum Pool Size</dt>
<dd>
<p>The minimum number of connections in the pool for the connection factory. The default value is 8.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Maximum Pool Size</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum number of connections in the pool. The default value is 32.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Pool Resize Quantity</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of connections to be removed when pool idle timeout expires. The default value is 2.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Idle Timeout</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum time in seconds that a connection can remain idle in the pool. The default value is 300.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Max Wait Time</dt>
<dd>
<p>The amount of time the application requesting a connection will wait before getting a connection timeout. The default value is 60000.</p>
</dd>
<dt>On Any Failure</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the Close All Connections checkbox is selected, GlassFish Server will close all connections in the pool and reestablish them if a single connection fails. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Transaction Support</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value may be any of the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>XATransaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>The resource can be used for transactions that involve the use of more than one resource within a transaction scope. This value is the default for a JMS connection factory.</p>
<p>For example, transactions may involve this resource plus a JDBC resource, a connector resource, or another JMS connection factory resource. This value offers the most flexibility. A resource that is configured as XATransaction will participate in two-phase commit operations.</p>
</dd>
<dt>LocalTransaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>The resource can be used either for transactions that involve only one resource within the transaction scope or as the last agent in a distributed transaction that involves more than one XA resource.</p>
<p>This value offers significantly better performance. A resource that is configured as LocalTransaction will not be used in two-phase commit operations.</p>
</dd>
<dt>NoTransaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>The resource can never participate in transactions. This setting is of limited use in JMS applications.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Connection Validation</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the Required checkbox is selected, connections are validated before being given to the application. If a resource's validation fails, it is destroyed, and a new resource is created and returned. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Additional Properties</dt>
<dd>
<p>Additional properties for the connection factory.</p>
<p>For information on available properties, see <a href="ref-jmsconnectionproperties.html">Properties Specific to JMS Connection Factories</a>.</p>
