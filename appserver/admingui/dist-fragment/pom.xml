        <!--
         In this module, all the files are statically stored as-is in the Subversion repository,
         so the simple copying from src/main/resources to target/classes that Maven does by default
         is suffice.

         But in more complex scenario, one can use maven-antrun-extended-plugin and use a series of Ant tasks
         to perform processing on resources, such as token replacement, file generation, pre-processing, etc.

         The following section shows how you can do this.
