<h4>Batch Job Executions</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>Payara Server provides a batch runtime for the scheduling and execution of batch jobs. Batch jobs are typically long-running, bulk-oriented tasks that contain a series of steps. Batch applications submit jobs to the batch runtime and provide instructions about how and when to execute the steps. The batch runtime processes the steps and stores information about jobs in a job repository. In Payara Server, the job repository is a database.</p>
<p>Use the Batch Job Executions page to view details about recorded executions of batch jobs.</p>
<p>The Batch Job Executions page contains the following information.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Instance Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the Payara server instance to which the configuration applies.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Batch Jobs</dt>
<dd>
<p>A list of recorded batch job executions for the instance. For each execution, the following information is displayed:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Execution ID</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ID assigned to the execution of the batch job. Clicking the execution ID opens the Batch Job Execution Details page for the execution. A new execution is created the first time a job is started and every time the existing execution is restarted.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Job Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the job.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Batch Status</dt>
<dd>
<p>The status of the execution as set by the batch runtime.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exit Status</dt>
<dd>
<p>The status of the execution as set by the Job XML for the job or by the batch application. By default, the exit status and the batch status are the same unless the exit status is explicitly overridden.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Instance ID</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ID assigned to the instance of the batch job. An instance of a batch job can have multiple executions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Start Time</dt>
<dd>
<p>The time the execution started.</p>
</dd>
<dt>End Time</dt>
<dd>
<p>The time the execution finished.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
