<p>Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC) technology provides connectivity to relational databases. In the GlassFish Server, you configure database connectivity by adding JDBC resources (data sources) to the domain. A data source is a Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE platform) standard method of configuring connectivity to a database. Each data source contains a pool of database connections. Applications look up the data source on the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API tree or in the local application context and then retrieve a database connection with the <code>getConnection</code> method. Data sources and their connection pools provide connection management processes that help keep your system running.</p>
<p>GlassFish Server includes a copy of the Java DB database and is preconfigured with the ability to access this database.</p>
