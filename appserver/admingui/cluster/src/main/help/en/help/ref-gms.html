<p>Use the Group Management Service page to change GMS settings.</p>
<p>The Group Management Service (GMS) is an in-process service that provides cluster monitoring, cluster membership, and group communication services. The GMS is built atop a configurable stack of group membership discovery and health monitoring protocols. The GMS performs the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notifies registered modules in a GlassFish Server instance when one or more member instances are added to or removed from a cluster, or are suspected or confirmed to have failed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides the ability to send and receive messages between cluster members.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Group Management Service page contains the following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Load Defaults</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to restore settings that have default values to their default values. Settings that do not have default values are not changed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Configuration Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the configuration to which the settings on this page apply. This field is read only.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Maximum Missed Heartbeats</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of missed heartbeats from a member after which a server instance failure is suspected. The default is 3.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Heartbeat Frequency</dt>
<dd>
<p>The period of time between missed heartbeats from a member. The default is 2000 milliseconds.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Group Discovery Timeout</dt>
<dd>
<p>The amount of time that the GMS waits for discovery of other cluster members. The default is 5000 milliseconds.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Failure Verification Wait Time</dt>
<dd>
<p>The amount of time to wait before verifying that a member that is suspected to have failed should be reported as failed. The default is 1500 milliseconds.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Additional Properties</dt>
<dd>
<p>A table of additional properties for the Group Management Service.</p>
<p>GlassFish Server does not define any additional GMS properties.</p>
<p>For each property, the following information is displayed:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the property.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Value</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value that of the property that is set for the selected instance.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>A textual description that provides more information about the property.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Additional Properties table also contains the following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Add Property</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to add a property. Clicking this button adds a row to the Additional Properties table.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Delete Properties</dt>
