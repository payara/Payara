<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>The Group Management Service (GMS) is an in-process service that provides cluster monitoring, cluster membership, and group communication services. The GMS performs the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notifies registered modules in a GlassFish Server instance when one or more member instances are added to or removed from a cluster, or are suspected or confirmed to have failed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides the ability to send and receive messages between cluster members.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the navigation tree, expand the Clusters node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the cluster for which you are enabling the Group Management Service (GMS).</p>
<p>The General Information page for the cluster opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the GMS Enabled checkbox to enable the GMS for the cluster.</p>
<p>This option is selected by default. To disable the GMS for the cluster, remove the check from the GMS Enabled checkbox.</p>
<p>If enabled, the Group Management Service is started in each server instance in the cluster and in the Domain Administration Server (DAS). The DAS participates in each cluster that has GMS enabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
