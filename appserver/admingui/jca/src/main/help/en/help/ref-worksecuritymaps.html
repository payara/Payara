<p>Use the Work Security Maps page to configure work security maps for resource adapters.</p>
<p>A connector work security map maps the caller identity of the work submitted by a resource adapter EIS principal or EIS user group to a suitable principal or user group in the GlassFish Server security domain. One or more work security maps may be associated with a resource adapter. The connector work security map configuration supports the use of the wild card asterisk (<code>*</code>) to indicate all users or all user groups.</p>
<p>A work security map is different from a security map for a connector connection pool, which maps the principal received during servlet or EJB authentication to the credentials accepted by the EIS. See <a href="ref-connectorsecuritymaps.html">Connector Connection Pool Security Maps</a> for information about security maps for connector connection pools.</p>
<p>The enterprise information system (EIS) is any system that holds the data of an organization. It can be a mainframe, a messaging system, a database system, or an application.</p>
<p>For each work security map, the following information is provided.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the work security map.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Work Security Maps table also contains the following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>New</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to create a new work security map.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Delete</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to delete one or more selected work security maps.</p>
</dd>
