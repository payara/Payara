<h4><a id="sthref14" name="sthref14"></a>To Edit Connector Connection Pool Advanced Attributes</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the navigation tree, expand the Resources node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expand the Connectors node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the Connectors node, select the Connector Connection Pools node.</p>
<p>The Connector Connection Pools page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Connector Connection Pools page, click the name of the connector connection pool that you are editing.</p>
<p>The Edit Connector Connection Pool page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Edit Connector Connection Pool page, click the Advanced tab.</p>
<p>The Edit Connector Connection Pool Advanced Attributes page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Validate At Most Once field, type the amount of time, in seconds, after which a connection is validated at most once.</p>
<p>Setting this attribute to an appropriate value minimizes the number of validation requests by a connection. Default value is 0, which means that the attribute is not enabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Leak Timeout field, type the amount of time, in seconds, to trace connection leaks in a connection pool.</p>
<p>A value of 0 indicates that connection leak tracing is disabled. The default value is 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Leak Reclaim checkbox to enable leaked connections to be restored to the pool after leak connection tracing is complete.</p>
<p>This option is disabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Creation Retry Attempts field, type the number of attempts that will be made if there is a failure in creating a new connection.</p>
<p>A value of 0 indicates that no attempts will be made to create the connection again. The default value is 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Retry Interval field, type the interval, in seconds, between two attempts to create a connection.</p>
<p>This attribute is used only if the value of Creation Retry Attempts is greater than 0. The default value is 10 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Pooling checkbox to enable connection pooling for the pool.</p>
<p>This option is enabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Lazy Association checkbox to enable connections to be lazily associated when an operation is performed on them.</p>
<p>The connections are disassociated when the transaction is completed and a component method ends, which helps reuse of the physical connections. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Lazy Connection Enlistment checkbox to enlist a resource to the transaction only when it is actually used in a method.</p>
<p>This option is disabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Associate with Thread checkbox to associate a connection with a thread.</p>
<p>When the same thread is in need of a connection, it can reuse the connection already associated with it, thereby not incurring the overhead of getting a connection from the pool. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Match Connections checkbox to enable connection matching for the pool.</p>
<p>Disable this option if you know that the connections in the pool will always be homogeneous and hence a connection picked from the pool need not be matched by the resource adapter. This option is enabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Match Connection Usage field, type the number of times a connection should be reused by the pool.</p>
<p>Once a connection is reused for the specified number of times, it will be closed. A value of 0 indicates that this attribute is not enabled. The default value is 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Save.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>Tip:</b></p>
<p>To return to the default settings, click the Load Defaults button, then click Save.</p>
