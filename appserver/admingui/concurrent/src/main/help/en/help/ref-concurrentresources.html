<p>Concurrent resources are managed objects that provide concurrency capabilities to Java EE applications as defined in the JSR 236 specification, Concurrency Utilities for Java EE.</p>
<p>In GlassFish Server, you configure concurrent resources and make them available for use by application components such as servlets and EJBs. Concurrent resources are accessed through JNDI lookup or resource injection.</p>
