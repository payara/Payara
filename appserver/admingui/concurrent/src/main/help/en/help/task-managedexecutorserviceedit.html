<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the navigation tree, expand the Resources node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the Resources node, expand the Concurrent Resources node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the Concurrent Resources node, select Managed Executor Services.</p>
<p>The Managed Executor Services page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Managed Executor Services page, click the name of the resource that you are editing.</p>
<p>The Edit Managed Executor Service page opens.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>Note:</b></p>
<p>The JNDI name is a read-only field. You can only specify the JNDI name when you create a new resource. The logical JNDI name is also a read-only field and is displayed for the default resource. See <a href="../../../common/en/help/ref-logicaljndinames.html">Logical JNDI Names</a> for more information.</p>

<hr>

</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Context Information Enabled checkbox to propagate contexts to threads, and select the contexts that you want to propagate.</p>
<p>This option is enabled and all contexts are selected by default. Use Shift-click or Control-click to choose multiple contexts. If this option is disabled, contexts are not propagated, even if they are selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Thread Priority field, type the priority to assign to created threads.</p>
<p>The default value is 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Long-Running Tasks Enabled checkbox to use the resource to run long-running tasks.</p>
<p>If enabled, long-running tasks are not reported as stuck. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Hung After field, type the number of seconds tasks can execute before they are considered unresponsive.</p>
<p>The default value is 0, which means that tasks are never considered unresponsive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Deployment Order field, type a number to specify the deployment order of the resource.</p>
<p>Resources with lower numbers are loaded first at server startup. The default value is 100.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Description field, type a short description of the resource.</p>
<p>This description is a string value and can include a maximum of 250 characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Core Size field, type the number of threads to keep in a thread pool, even if they are idle.</p>
<p>When a new task is submitted and the number of running threads is less than core size, a new thread is created to handle the request. The default value is 0, which means that new threads are never created unless the task queue is full or the resource is using direct queuing. Direct queuing occurs when task queue capacity is 0, or when task queue capacity is 2147483647 and core size is 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Maximum Pool Size field, type the maximum number of threads a thread pool can contain.</p>
<p>The default value is 2147483647, which means that the thread pool is essentially unbounded and can contain any number of threads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Keep Alive field, type the number of seconds threads can remain idle when the number of threads is greater than core size.</p>
<p>The default value is 60.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Thread Lifetime field, type the number of seconds threads can remain in a thread pool before being purged, regardless of whether the number of threads is greater than core size or whether the threads are idle.</p>
<p>The default value is 0, which means that threads are never purged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Task Queue Capacity field, type the number of submitted tasks that can be stored in the task queue awaiting execution.</p>
<p>The default value is 2147483647, which means that the task queue is essentially unbounded and can store any number of submitted tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Additional Properties section, do not add any additional properties.</p>
<p>GlassFish Server does not define any additional properties for this resource type. Moreover, this resource type does not currently use any additional properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the Target tab to manage resource targets.</p>
<p>The Resource Targets page opens. The Target tab is displayed only if clusters and standalone instances have been created in the domain, in addition to the default server instance, <code>server</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Resource Targets page, do the following, as desired:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Enable or disable defined targets for the resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the Manage Targets button to add or remove targets for the resource.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the General tab to return to the Edit Managed Executor Service page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Save.</p>
</li>
</ol>
