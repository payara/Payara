<h4>Managed Scheduled Executor Services<a id="sthref35" name="sthref35"></a><a id="sthref36" name="sthref36"></a></h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>Managed scheduled executor services are used by applications to execute submitted tasks asynchronously at specific times. Tasks are executed on threads that are started and managed by the container. The context of the container is propagated to the thread executing the task.</p>
<p>Use the Managed Scheduled Executor Services page to configure managed scheduled executor service resources.</p>
<p>For each managed scheduled executor service resource, the following information is provided.</p>
<dl>
<dt>JNDI Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>A unique name that identifies the resource.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Logical JNDI Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The logical JNDI name for the resource. See <a href="../../../common/en/help/ref-logicaljndinames.html">Logical JNDI Names</a> for more information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Enabled</dt>
<dd>
<p>(This column is displayed if only the default server instance, <code>server</code>, exists in the domain.)</p>
<p>A check mark if the resource is enabled, or an X if the resource is disabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Status</dt>
<dd>
<p>(This column is displayed if any clusters or standalone instances have been created in the domain.)</p>
<p>The number of clusters and standalone instances to which the resource is targeted and how many of these targets the resource is enabled on. For example, "Enabled on 2 of 4 Target(s)" means that the resource is targeted to four clusters and standalone instances and that it is enabled on two of these four targets.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Context Information</dt>
<dd>
<p>The container contexts propagated to threads.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Thread Priority</dt>
<dd>
<p>The priority assigned to threads.</p>
