<h4>To Create a Context Service<a id="sthref2" name="sthref2"></a></h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>A context service is used to create dynamic proxy objects that capture the context of a container and enable applications to run within that context at a later time. The context of the container is propagated to the thread executing the task.</p>
<p>In GlassFish Server, you configure a context service resource and make it available for use by application components such as servlets and EJBs.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the navigation tree, expand the Resources node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the Resources node, expand the Concurrent Resources node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the Concurrent Resources node, select Context Services.</p>
<p>The Context Services page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Context Services page, click New.</p>
<p>The New Context Service page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the JNDI Name field, type a unique name that identifies the resource.</p>
<p>The JNDI name is registered in the JNDI naming service and used by applications to look up the resource. Use the <code>concurrent/</code><i>name</i> format. For example, <code>concurrent/myContextService</code>. The name can contain only alphanumeric, underscore, dash, or dot characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Context Information Enabled checkbox to propagate contexts to threads, and select the contexts that you want to propagate.</p>
<p>This option is enabled and all contexts are selected by default. Use Shift-click or Control-click to choose multiple contexts. If this option is disabled, contexts are not propagated, even if they are selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Description field, type a short description of the resource.</p>
<p>This description is a string value and can include a maximum of 250 characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Status Enabled checkbox to enable the resource.</p>
<p>This option is enabled by default, which means that the resource is available as soon as it is created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Additional Properties section, do not add any additional properties.</p>
<p>GlassFish Server does not define any additional properties for this resource type. Moreover, this resource type does not currently use any additional properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Targets section, specify the selected targets for the resource.</p>
<p>Targets are displayed only if clusters and standalone instances have been created in the domain, in addition to the default server instance, <code>server</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click OK.</p>
</li>
</ol>
