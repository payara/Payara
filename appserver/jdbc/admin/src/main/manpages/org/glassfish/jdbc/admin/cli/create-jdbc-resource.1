DESCRIPTION
       The create-jdbc-resource subcommand creates a new JDBC resource.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --connectionpoolid
           The name of the JDBC connection pool. If two or more JDBC resource
           elements point to the same connection pool element, they use the
           same pool connection at runtime.

       --enabled
           Determines whether the JDBC resource is enabled at runtime. The
           default value is true.

       --description
           Text providing descriptive details about the JDBC resource.

       --property
           Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the resource.

       --target
           This option helps specify the target to which you are deploying.
           Valid values are:

           server
               Deploys the component to the default server instance. This is
               the default value.

           domain
               Deploys the component to the domain.

           cluster_name
               Deploys the component to every server instance in the cluster.

           instance_name
               Deploys the component to a particular server instance.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           The resource is always       |
           |           created for the domain as a  |
           |           whole, but the resource-ref  |
           |           for the resource is only     |
           |           created for the specified    |
           |           --target. This means that    |
           |           although the resource is     |
           |           defined at the domain level, |
           |           it is only available at the  |
           |           specified target level. Use  |
           |           the create-resource-ref      |
           |           subcommand to refer to the   |
           |           resource in multiple targets |
           |           if needed.                   |
           +----------------------------------------+
