NAME
       delete-jdbc-resource - removes a JDBC resource with the specified JNDI
       name

SYNOPSIS
           delete-jdbc-resource [--help] [--target target] jndi_name

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-jdbc-resource subcommand removes a JDBC resource. Ensure
       that all associations to the JDBC resource are removed before running
       this subcommand.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           This option helps specify the target from which you are removing
           the JDBC resource. Valid targets are:

           server
               Removes the resource from the default server instance. This is
               the default value.

           domain
               Removes the resource from the domain.

           cluster_name
               Removes the resource from every server instance in the cluster.

           instance_name
               Removes the resource from a particular server instance.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           Resources are always created |
           |           for a domain as a whole but  |
           |           are only active for targets  |
           |           for which a <resource-ref>   |
           |           has been created using the   |
           |           --target option when the     |
           |           resource was created. This   |
           |           means that deleting a        |
           |           resource only deletes the    |
           |           <resource-ref> element for   |
           |           the specified --target, and  |
           |           does not delete the resource |
           |           from the domain as a whole   |
           |           unless domain is specified   |
           |           as the --target for the      |
           |           deletion.                    |
           +----------------------------------------+
