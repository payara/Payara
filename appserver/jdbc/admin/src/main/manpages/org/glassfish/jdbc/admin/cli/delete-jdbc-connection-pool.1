delete-jdbc-connection-pool(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands  delete-jdbc-connection-pool(1)

NAME
       delete-jdbc-connection-pool - removes the specified JDBC connection
       pool

SYNOPSIS
           delete-jdbc-connection-pool [--help]
           [--cascade={false|true}]
           [--target target]
           jdbc_connection_pool_id

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-jdbc-connection-pool subcommand deletes a JDBC connection
       pool. Before running this subcommand, all associations to the JDBC
       connection pool must be removed.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --cascade
           If the option is set to true, all the JDBC resources associated
           with the pool, apart from the pool itself, are deleted. When set to
           false, the deletion of pool fails if any resources are associated
           with the pool. Resources must be deleted explicitly or the option
           must be set to true. The default value is false.

       --target
           Do not specify this option. This option is retained for
           compatibility with earlier releases. If you specify this option, a
           syntax error does not occur. Instead, the subcommand runs
           successfully and displays a warning message that the option is
           ignored.

OPERANDS
       jdbc_connection_pool_id
           The name of the JDBC resource to be removed.
