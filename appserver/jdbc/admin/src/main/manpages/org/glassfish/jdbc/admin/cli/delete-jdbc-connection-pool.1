DESCRIPTION
       The delete-jdbc-connection-pool subcommand deletes a JDBC connection
       pool. Before running this subcommand, all associations to the JDBC
       connection pool must be removed.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS

           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --cascade
           If the option is set to true, all the JDBC resources associated
           with the pool, apart from the pool itself, are deleted. When set to

           with the pool. Resources must be deleted explicitly or the option
           must be set to true. The default value is false.
