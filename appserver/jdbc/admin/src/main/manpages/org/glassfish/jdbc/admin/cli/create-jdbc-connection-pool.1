DESCRIPTION
       The create-jdbc-connection-pool subcommand registers a new Java
       Database Connectivity ("JDBC") software connection pool with the
       specified JDBC connection pool name.

       A JDBC connection pool with authentication can be created either by
       using a --property option to specify user, password, or other
       connection information, or by specifying the connection information in
       the XML descriptor file.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --datasourceclassname
           The name of the vendor-supplied JDBC datasource resource manager.
           An XA or global transactions capable datasource class will
           implement the javax.sql.XADatasource interface. Non-XA or
           exclusively local transaction datasources will implement the
           javax.sql.Datasource interface.

       --restype, Required when a datasource class implements two or more
       interfaces (javax.sql.DataSource, javax.sql.XADataSource, or
       javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource), or when a driver classname must be
       provided.

           *   If --restype = java.sql.Driver, then the --driverclassname
               option is required.

           *   If --restype = javax.sql.DataSource, javax.sql.XADataSource, or
               javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource, then the
               --datasourceclassname option is required.

           *   If --restype is not specified, then either the
               --driverclassname or --datasourceclassname option must be
               specified, but not both.

       --steadypoolsize
           The minimum and initial number of connections maintained in the
           pool. The default value is 8.

       --maxpoolsize
           The maximum number of connections that can be created. The default
           value is 32.

       --maxwait
           The amount of time, in milliseconds, that a caller will wait before
           a connection timeout is sent. The default is 60000 (60 seconds). A
           value of 0 forces the caller to wait indefinitely.

       --poolresize
           Number of connections to be removed when idle-timeout-in-seconds
           timer expires. This is the quantity by which the pool will scale up
           or scale down the number of connections. Scale up: When the pool
           has no free connections, pool will scale up by this quantity. Scale
           down: All the invalid and idle connections are removed, sometimes
           resulting in removing connections of quantity greater than this
           value. Connections that have been idle for longer than the timeout
           are candidates for removal. Steadypoolsize will be ensured.
           Possible values are from 0 to MAX_INTEGER. The default value is 2.

       --idletimeout
           The maximum time, in seconds, that a connection can remain idle in
           the pool. After this time, the implementation can close this
           connection. This timeout value must be kept shorter than the
           database server side timeout value to prevent the accumulation of
           unusable connections in the application. The default value is 300.

       --initsql
           An SQL string that is executed whenever a connection is created
           from the pool. If an existing connection is reused, this string is
           not executed. Connections that have idled for longer than the
           timeout are candidates for removal. This option has no default
           value.

       --isolationlevel
           The transaction-isolation-level on the pooled database connections.
           This option does not have a default value. If not specified, the
           pool operates with the default isolation level that the JDBC driver
           provides. You can set a desired isolation level using one of the
           standard transaction isolation levels: read-uncommitted,
           read-committed, repeatable-read, serializable. Applications that
           change the isolation level on a pooled connection programmatically
           risk polluting the pool. This could lead to program errors.

       --isisolationguaranteed
           This is applicable only when a particular isolation level is
           specified for transaction-isolation-level. The default value is
           true.

           This option assures that every time a connection is obtained from
           the pool, isolation level is set to the desired value. This could
           have some performance impact on some JDBC drivers. Administrators
           can set this to false when the application does not change
           --isolationlevel before returning the connection.

       --isconnectvalidatereq
           If set to true, connections are validated or checked to see if they
           are usable before giving out to the application. The default value
           is false.

       --validationmethod
           Type of validation to be performed when
           is-connection-validation-required is true. Valid settings are:
           auto-commit, meta-data, table, or custom-validation. The default
           value is table.

       --validationtable
           The name of the validation table used to perform a query to
           validate a connection. If is-connection-validation-required is set
           to true and connection-validation-type set to table, this option is
           mandatory.

       --failconnection
           If set to true, all connections in the pool must be closed when a
           single validation check fails. The default value is false. One
           attempt is made to reestablish failed connections.

       --allownoncomponentcallers
           A pool with this property set to true can be used by non-Java EE
           components, that is, components other than EJBs or Servlets. The
           returned connection is enlisted automatically with the transaction
           context obtained from the transaction manager. Connections obtained
           by non-component callers are not automatically cleaned by the
           container at the end of a transaction. These connections need to be
           explicitly closed by the caller.

       --nontransactionalconnections
           A pool with this property set to true returns non-transactional
           connections. This connection does not get automatically enlisted
           with the transaction manager.

       --validateatmostonceperiod
           Specifies the time interval in seconds between successive requests
           to validate a connection at most once. Setting this attribute to an
           appropriate value minimizes the number of validation requests by a
           connection. Default value is 0, which means that the attribute is
           not enabled.

       --leaktimeout
           Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, for which connection
           leaks in a connection pool are to be traced. When a connection is
           not returned to the pool by the application within the specified
           period, it is assumed to be a potential leak, and stack trace of
           the caller will be logged. This option only detects if there is a
           connection leak. The connection can be reclaimed only if
           connection-leak-reclaim is set to true.

           If connection leak tracing is enabled, you can use the
           Administration Console to enable monitoring of the JDBC connection
           pool to get statistics on the number of connection leaks. The
           default value is 0, which disables connection leak tracing.

       --leakreclaim
           Specifies whether leaked connections are restored to the connection
           pool after leak connection tracing is complete. Possible values are
           as follows:

           false
               Leaked connections are not restored to the connection pool
               (default).

           true
               Leaked connections are restored to the connection pool.

       --statementleaktimeout
           Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, after which any
           statements that have not been closed by an application are to be
           detected. Applications can run out of cursors if statement objects
           are not properly closed. This option only detects if there is a
           statement leak. The statement can be reclaimed only if
           statement-leak-reclaim is set to true. The leaked statement is
           closed when it is reclaimed.

           The stack trace of the caller that creates the statement will be
           logged when a statement leak is detected. If statement leak tracing
           is enabled, you can use the Administration Console to enable
           monitoring of the JDBC connection pool to get statistics on the
           number of statement leaks. The default value is 0, which disables
           statement leak tracing.

           The following limitations apply to the statement leak timeout
           value:

           *   The value must be less than the value set for the connection
               leak-timeout.

           *   The value must be greater than the value set for
               statement-timeout.

       --statementleakreclaim
           Specifies whether leaked statements are reclaimed after the
           statements leak. Possible values are as follows:

           false
               Leaked statements are not reclaimed (default).

           true
               Leaked statements are reclaimed.

       --creationretryattempts
           Specifies the maximum number of times that GlassFish Server retries
           to create a connection if the initial attempt fails. The default
           value is 0, which specifies that GlassFish Server does not retry to
           create the connection.

       --creationretryinterval
           Specifies the interval, in seconds, between successive attempts to
           create a connection.

           If --creationretryattempts is 0, the --creationretryinterval option
           is ignored. The default value is 10.

       --sqltracelisteners
           A list of one or more custom modules that provide custom logging of
           database activities. Each module must implement the
           org.glassfish.api.jdbc.SQLTraceListener public interface. When set
           to an appropriate value, SQL statements executed by applications
           are traced. This option has no default value.

       --statementtimeout
           Specifies the length of time in seconds after which a query that is
           not completed is terminated.

           A query that remains incomplete for a long period of time might
           cause the application that submitted the query to hang. To prevent
           this occurrence, use this option set a timeout for all statements
           that will be created from the connection pool that you are
           creating. When creating a statement, GlassFish Server sets the
           QueryTimeout property on the statement to the length of time that
           is specified. The default value is -1, which specifies that
           incomplete queries are never terminated.

       --lazyconnectionenlistment
           Specifies whether a resource to a transaction is enlisted only when
           a method actually uses the resource. Possible values are as
           follows:

           false
               Resources to a transaction are always enlisted and not only
               when a method actually uses the resource (default).

           true
               Resources to a transaction are enlisted only when a method
               actually uses the resource.

       --lazyconnectionassociation
           Specifies whether a physical connection should be associated with
           the logical connection only when the physical connection is used,
           and disassociated when the transaction is completed. Such
           association and dissociation enable the reuse of physical
           connections. Possible values are as follows:

           false
               A physical connection is associated with the logical connection
               even before the physical connection is used, and is not
               disassociated when the transaction is completed (default).

           true
               A physical connection is associated with the logical connection
               only when the physical connection is used, and disassociated
               when the transaction is completed. The
               --lazyconnectionenlistment option must also be set to true.

       --associatewiththread
           Specifies whether a connection is associated with the thread to
           enable the thread to reuse the connection. If a connection is not
           associated with the thread, the thread must obtain a connection
           from the pool each time that the thread requires a connection.
           Possible values are as follows:

           false
               A connection is not associated with the thread (default).

           true
               A connection is associated with the thread.

       --driverclassname
           The name of the vendor-supplied JDBC driver class. This driver
           should implement the java.sql.Driver interface.

       --matchconnections
           Specifies whether a connection that is selected from the pool
           should be matched by the resource adaptor. If all the connections
           in the pool are homogenous, a connection picked from the pool need
           not be matched by the resource adapter, which means that this
           option can be set to false. Possible values are as follows:

           false
               A connection should not be matched by the resource adaptor
               (default).

           true
               A connection should be matched by the resource adaptor.

       --logjdbccalls
           Specifies whether all SQL calls made through a JDBC connection pool
           are traced.

           false
               JDBC calls are not all logged (default)

           true
               Each call into the connection pool is timed and logged
               to the server log at FINE level.

       --maxconnectionusagecount
           Specifies the maximum number of times that a connection can be
           reused. When this limit is reached, the connection is closed. By
           limiting the maximum number of times that a connection can be
           reused, you can avoid statement leaks.

           The default value is 0, which specifies no limit on the number of
           times that a connection can be reused.

       --ping
           Specifies if the pool is pinged during pool creation or
           reconfiguration to identify and warn of any erroneous values for
           its attributes. Default value is false.

       --pooling
           Specifies if connection pooling is enabled for the pool. The
           default value is true.

       --statementcachesize
           The number of SQL statements to be cached using the default caching
           mechanism (Least Recently Used). The default value is 0, which
           indicates that statement caching is not enabled.

       --validationclassname
           The name of the class that provides custom validation when the
           value of validationmethod is custom-validation. This class must
           implement the org.glassfish.api.jdbc.ConnectionValidation
           interface, and it must be accessible to GlassFish Server. This
           option is mandatory if the connection validation type is set to
           custom validation.

       --wrapjdbcobjects
           Specifies whether the pooling infrastructure provides wrapped JDBC
           objects to applications. By providing wrapped JDBC objects, the
           pooling infrastructure prevents connection leaks by ensuring that
           applications use logical connections from the connection pool, not
           physical connections. The use of logical connections ensures that
           the connections are returned to the connection pool when they are
           closed. However, the provision of wrapped JDBC objects can impair
           the performance of applications. The default value is true.

           The pooling infrastructure provides wrapped objects for
           implementations of the following interfaces in the JDBC API:

           *   java.sql.CallableStatement

           *   java.sql.DatabaseMetaData

           *   java.sql.PreparedStatement

           *   java.sql.ResultSet

           *   java.sql.Statement

           Possible values of --wrapjdbcobjects are as follows:

           false
               The pooling infrastructure does not provide wrapped JDBC
               objects to applications. (default).

           true
               The pooling infrastructure provides wrapped JDBC objects to
               applications.

       --description
           Text providing details about the specified JDBC connection pool.

       --property
           Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the pool. The
           following properties are available:

           user
               Specifies the user name for connecting to the database.

           password
               Specifies the password for connecting to the database.

           databaseName
               Specifies the database for this connection pool.

           serverName
               Specifies the database server for this connection pool.

           port
               Specifies the port on which the database server listens for
               requests.

           networkProtocol
               Specifies the communication protocol.

           roleName
               Specifies the initial SQL role name.

           datasourceName
               Specifies an underlying XADataSource, or a
               ConnectionPoolDataSource if connection pooling is done.

           description
               Specifies a text description.

           url
               Specifies the URL for this connection pool. Although this is
               not a standard property, it is commonly used.

           dynamic-reconfiguration-wait-timeout-in-seconds
               Used to enable dynamic reconfiguration of the connection pool
               transparently to the applications that are using the pool, so
               that applications need not be re-enabled for the attribute or
               property changes to the pool to take effect. Any in-flight
               transaction's connection requests will be allowed to complete
               with the old pool configuration as long as the connection
               requests are within the timeout period, so as to complete the
               transaction. New connection requests will wait for the pool
               reconfiguration to complete and connections will be acquired
               using the modified pool configuration.
