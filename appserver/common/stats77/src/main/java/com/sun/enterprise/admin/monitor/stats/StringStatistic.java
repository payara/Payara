/**
 * Custom statistic type created for the Sun ONE Application Server.
 * The goal is to be able to represent changing attribute values that are strings
 * in the form of Statistics. Semantically, it is analogous to a {@link CountStatistic},
 * the only difference being in the value that is returned. Unlike a CountStatistic
 * (which always is unidirectional), this Statistic type is not having any
 * specified direction, simply because there is no natural order. An example
 * of the values that an instance of this statistic type can assume is: A State
 * Statistic which can have "CONNECTED, CLOSED, DISCONNECTED" as the permissible
 * values and the current value can be any one of them (and them only). 
 * The permissible values
 * are upto a particular implementation.
