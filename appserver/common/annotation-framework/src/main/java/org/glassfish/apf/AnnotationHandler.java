/**
 * This interface defines the contract for annotation handlers

 * is registered for a particular annotation type and will be 
 * called by the engine when such annotation type is encountered.
 *
 * The AnnotationHandler is a stateless object, no state should 
 * be stored, instead users should use the ProcessingContext.
 *
 * Annotation can be defined or processed in random orders on a 
 * particular type, however, a particular annotation may need 
 * other annotation to be processed before itself in order to be 
 * processed successfully. An annotation type can indicate through
 * the @see getAnnotations() method which annotation types should 
 * be processed before itself.
 *
 * Each implementation of this interface must specify the annotation that it can handle using
 * {@link AnnotationHandlerFor} annotation.
