 * All the processing configuration (input classes, error handlers, etc...)
 * is provided by the ProcessingContext which can be either created from the 
 * createContext method or through another mean. Once the ProcessingContext has 
 * been initialized, it is passed to the process(ProcessingContext ctx) method which
 * triggers the annotation processing. 
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each class accessible from the ProcessingContext.getInputScanner instance, will be 
 * scanned for annotations. 
 * Each annotation will then be processed by invoking the corresponding AnnotationHandler
 * from its annotation type. 
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The AnnotationProcessor can be configured by using the pushAnnotationHandler and 
 * popAnnotationHandler which allow new AnnotationHandler instances to be registered and 
 * unregistered for a particular annotation type.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Even without reconfiguring the AnnotationProcessor instance with the above 
 * configuration methods, the AnnotationProcessor implementation cannot guarantee
 * to be thread safe, therefore, it is encouraged the make instanciation cheap
 * and users should not use the same instance concurrently.
