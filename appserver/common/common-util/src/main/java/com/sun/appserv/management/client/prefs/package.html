<p>Contains classes and interfaces to edit information about login to a particular domain (especially admin user
name and password)</p>

Following is the way to use the classes and interfaces in this package:
<pre>
final LoginInfoStore lis = LoginInfoStoreFactory.getDefaultStore();
final LoginInfo li       = new LoginInfo("localhost", 4848, "admin", "admin123");

lis.store(li, true); //overwrites the login information for "localhost" and 4848
</pre>
<P>
The default store for login information in the file ".asadminpass" in the user's home
directory. The format of the file is as follows:
<ul>
<li> A line terminated by line termination character contains login information for one domain.</li>
<li> The Login Information is stored like uri-encoding-of-host-port-admin-user-name encoded-admin-password</li>
</ul>
An example of stored login information would be:
<P>
asadmin://joe%20bloe@localhost:4848 TW9oYW1tYWQgQXNpZiB0byBLaGFu
