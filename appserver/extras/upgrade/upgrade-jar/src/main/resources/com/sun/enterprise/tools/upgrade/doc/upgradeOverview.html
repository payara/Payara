<h1>Upgrade Tool: An Overview</h1>
<p>Use the Upgrade Tool to transfer configuration information from an
Application Server 9.1 or GlassFish Prelude
installation to a GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 3.1 installation.
Information that is transferred includes data
about
deployed applications, the file realm, security certificates, and other
resource and server configuration settings.</p>
<p>The tool automatically detects the version of the specified source
server installation.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Note: </b><em>Before starting the upgrade process, make sure
that both the source server (the server from which you are upgrading)
and the target server (the server to which you are upgrading) are
stopped.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p>
<h2 class="sol">Upgrade Terminology</h2>
<p>The following are important terms related to the upgrade process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Source Domain Directory: the old domain that will be upgraded to
    the new server. The original domain is not changed; it is copied
    and the copy is upgraded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Target Domains Root Directory: the domains directory of installation to
      which you are upgrading. This can be any directory, but if the source
    domain is being moved from one SERVER_HOME/domains directory to the
    other, 3rd part jar files can be copied from the source server to the
    target server.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Master Password: the master password of the target server. Leave
      blank for the default.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
