#
# A script to append deploy commands to the post boot command file at
# $PAYARA_HOME/scripts/post-boot-commands.asadmin file. All applications in the
# $DEPLOY_DIR (either files or folders) will be deployed.
# The $POSTBOOT_COMMANDS file can then be used with the start-domain using the
#  --postbootcommandfile parameter to deploy applications on startup.
#
# Usage:
# ./generate_deploy_commands.sh
#
# Optionally, any number of parameters of the asadmin deploy command can be
# specified as parameters to this script.
# E.g., to deploy applications with implicit CDI scanning disabled:
#
# ./generate_deploy_commands.sh --properties=implicitCdiEnabled=false
#
# Environment variables used:
#   - $PREBOOT_COMMANDS - the pre boot command file.
#   - $PREBOOT_COMMANDS_FINAL - copy of the pre boot command file.
#   - $POSTBOOT_COMMANDS - the post boot command file.
#   - $POSTBOOT_COMMANDS_FINAL - copy of the post boot command file.
#
# Note that many parameters to the deploy command can be safely used only when
# a single application exists in the $DEPLOY_DIR directory.
