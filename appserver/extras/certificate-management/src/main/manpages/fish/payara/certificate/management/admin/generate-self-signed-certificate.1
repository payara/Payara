generate-self-signed-certificate(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands generate-self-signed-certificate(1)

NAME
       generate-self-signed-certificate - generates a self-signed certificate using provided
       distinguished name, subject alternative names, and alias, before placing it in the
       target instance or listener's key and trust stores.

SYNOPSIS
           generate-self-signed-certificate [--help]
           [--domainname domain-name] [--domaindir domain-dir]
           [--node node-name] [--nodedir node-dir]
           [--target instance-name] [--listener listener-name]
           [alternativenames (type:value)[;type:value]*]
           --distinguishedname
           alias

DESCRIPTION
       The generate-self-signed-certificate subcommand generates a self-
       signed certificate using the provided distinguished name, alias, and
       any provided alternative names. This certificate is then placed in
       the key and trust store of the target instance or listener.

       If the instance or listener is configured to use the default key and
       trust store, the command will instead synchronise the instance with
       the DAS (under the assumption the certificate has been added to the
       default key and trust store of the DAS), since any certificates added
       to the instance stores would be lost upon next synchronisation.

       If the instance or listener is not configured to use the default stores
       then the certificate must be added manually with the add-to-keystore
       and add-to-truststore commands.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --domainname, --domain_name
           The unique name of the domain to add the certificate to. This operand
           is optional, defaulting to domain1 if not provided.

       --domaindir
           The domain root directory, which contains the directory of the
           target domain. If specified, the path must be accessible in the
           file system. The default location of the domain root directory
           is as-install/domains.

       --node
           The unique name of the node where the target instance is located.
           This operand is optional, defaulting to localhost-$domainname
           if not provided.

       --nodedir
           The node root directory, which contains the target node.
           If specified, the path must be accessible in the
           file system. The default location of the node root directory
           is as-install/nodes.

       --target
           The name of the instance to add the generated certificate to the
           key and trust store of. Defaults to server (the DAS).

       --listener
           The name of the HTTP or IIOP listener to add the generated
           certificate to the key and trust store of. Only applicable if
           the listener has a key or trust store different to that of the
           instance itself.

       --alternativenames, --altnames
           The subject alternative names to add to the generated certificate.
           Takes the form of a semi-colon separated list of type:value. If no
           type is given, it is assumed to be DNS.

       --distinguishedname, --dn
           The distinguished name to use when generating the certificate.

OPERANDS

       alias
           The alias to use when generating the certificate and storing it
           in the key and trust stores. If the alias already exists in the
           key store, the command will fail. If the alias already exists in
           the trust store, this trusted certificate will be overwritten.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating a Self-Signed Certificate for the DAS

           This example creates a self-signed certificate for the DAS.

               asadmin> generate-self-signed-certificate --dn "CN=test.payara.fish" test_cert1

       Example 2, Create a Self-Signed Certificate for a Listener

           This example creates a self-signed certificate with alternative
           names for the http-listner-2 listener of an instance named Guppy1.

               asadmin> generate-self-signed-certificate --dn "CN=test.payara.fish"
               --listener http-listener-2
               --alternativenames "test2.payara.fish;DNS:test3.payara.fish,IP:127.0.0.1,EMAIL:anon@payara.fish"
               --target Guppy1
               test_cert2
