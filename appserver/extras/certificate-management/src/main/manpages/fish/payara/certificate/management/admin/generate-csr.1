generate-csr(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands generate-csr(1)

NAME
       generate-csr - generates a certificate signing request from the certificate in
       the target instance or listener's key store that matches the provided alias.

SYNOPSIS
           generate-csr [--help]
           [--domain_name domain-name] [--domaindir domain-dir]
           [--node node-name] [--nodedir node-dir]
           [--target instance-name] [--listener listener-name]
           alias

DESCRIPTION
       The generate-csr subcommand generates a certificate signing request from the
       certificate in the target instance or listener's key store that matches the
       provided alias. A user can then send this CSR to their chosen Certificate
       Authority (CA) to receive a CA issued certificate and replace the self-signed
       certificate. The CSRs are placed in payara5/glassfish/tls and match the name
       of the alias.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --domain_name
           The unique name of the domain to get the certificate for the CSR from.
           This operand is optional, defaulting to domain1 if not provided.

       --domaindir
           The domain root directory, which contains the directory of the
           target domain. If specified, the path must be accessible in the
           file system. The default location of the domain root directory
           is as-install/domains.

       --node
           The unique name of the node where the target instance is located.
           This operand is optional, defaulting to localhost-$domainname
           if not provided.

       --nodedir
           The node root directory, which contains the target node.
           If specified, the path must be accessible in the
           file system. The default location of the node root directory
           is as-install/nodes.

       --target
           The name of the instance to get the certificate for the CSR
           from. Defaults to server (the DAS).

       --listener
           The name of the HTTP or IIOP listener to get the certificate for the
           CSR from. Only applicable if the listener has a key or trust store
           different to that of the instance itself.

OPERANDS
       alias
           The alias of the certificate to create a CSR for. This alias is also
           used for the file name of the generated CSR.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating a CSR for the DAS

           This example creates a CSR for the default s1as self-signed certificate for the DAS.

               asadmin> generate-csr s1as

       Example 2, Create a CSR for a Listener

           This example creates a CSR for a self-signed certificate named glassfish-instance in
           the key store of the http-listener-2 listener of an instance named Instance1

               asadmin> generate-csr --target Instance1 --listener http-listener-2 glassfish-instance

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
