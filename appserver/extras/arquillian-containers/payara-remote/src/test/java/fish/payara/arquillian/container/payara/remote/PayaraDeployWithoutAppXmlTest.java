/**
 * A test to serve as a regression test for ARQ-658.
 * <p>
 * The deployment created by this class, does not have an application.xml file.
 * As a result, the context root is created by GlassFish,
 * instead of being specified by the developer.
 * Such context roots do not begin with a forward slash,
 * and the Arquillian REST client should recognize them.
 * <p>
 * The class is a converse test for the PayaraRestDeployEarTest class,
 * which adds an application.xml file with a user-specified context root.
