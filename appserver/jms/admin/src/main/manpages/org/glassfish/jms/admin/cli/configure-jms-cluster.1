       JMS services to a GlassFish Server cluster

DESCRIPTION
       The configure-jms-cluster configures the Message Queue cluster
       providing JMS services to a GlassFish Server cluster.

       This subcommand should be used before the GlassFish Server cluster is
       started for the first time. Otherwise, follow the instructions in
       "Administering the Java Message Service (JMS)" in Oracle GlassFish
       Server Administration Guide.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only. Remote asadmin
       subcommands require a running domain administration server (DAS).

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --clustertype
           The type of Message Queue cluster to configure. The value
           conventional specifies a conventional cluster, and the value
           enhanced specifies an enhanced, high-availability cluster. For
           information about these cluster types of Message Queue clusters,
           see "Broker Clusters" in Oracle GlassFish Server Message Queue
           Technical Overview.

           The default value is conventional.

           If enhanced is specified, the configstoretype and messagestoretype
           options are ignored.

       --configstoretype
           The type of data store for configuration data in a conventional
           cluster. The value masterbroker specifies the use of a master
           broker to store and manage the configuration data. The value
           shareddb specifies the use of a shared database to store the
           configuration data.

           The default value is masterbroker.

           This option is ignored if clustertype is set to enhanced.

       --messagestoretype
           The type of data store for message data in brokers in a
           conventional cluster. The value file specifies a file store. The
           value jdbc specifies a JDBC store.

           The default value is file.

           This option is ignored if clustertype is set to enhanced.

       --dbvendor, --dbuser, --dburl
           The database vendor, user, and access url of the JDBC database to
           use in any of these situations:

           *   When clustertype is set to enhanced

           *   When configstoretype is set to shareddb

           *   When messagestoretype is set to jdbc

           For information about supported vendors and the formats of access
           urls for each vendor, see "JDBC-Based Persistence" in Oracle
           GlassFish Server Message Queue Administration Guide.

               Note
               +---------------------------------------+
               |To specify the password of the JDBC    |
               |database user, use the --passwordfile  |
               |utility option of the asadmin(1M)      |
               |command after adding the entry         |
               |AS_ADMIN_JMSDBPASSWORD to the password |
               |file.                                  |
               +---------------------------------------+

       --property
           A list of additional database-vendor-specific properties to
           configure the JDBC database for use by the Message Queue cluster.
           Specify properties as a colon (:) separated list of property names
           and values in the form:

               prop1name=prop1value:prop2name=prop2value

OPERANDS
       cluster-name
           The name of the GlassFish Server cluster for which the Message
           Queue cluster is to provide JMS services.

           Because GlassFish Server uses the cluster name to uniquely identify
           database tables the Message Queue cluster might require, the length
           of the name is restricted in the following situations:

           *   If clustertype is set to enhanced, the name can be no longer
               than n–21 characters, where n is the maximum table name length
               allowed by the database.

           *   If configstoretype is set to shareddb, the name can be no
               longer than n–19 characters, where n is the maximum table name
               length allowed by the database.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           subcommand executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the subcommand
