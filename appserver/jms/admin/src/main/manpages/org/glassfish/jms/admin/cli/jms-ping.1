NAME
       jms-ping - checks if the JMS service is up and running

SYNOPSIS
           jms-ping [--help]
           [-- target target]

DESCRIPTION
       The jms-ping subcommand checks if the Java Message Service (JMS)
       service (also known as the JMS provider) is up and running. When you
       start the GlassFish Server, the JMS service starts by default.

       The jms-ping subcommand pings only the default JMS host within the JMS
       service. It displays an error message when it is unable to ping a
       built-in JMS service.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only. Remote asadmin
       subcommands require a running domain administration server (DAS).

       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which the operation is to be performed.
           Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Pings the JMS service for the default server instance. This is
               the default value

           configuration-name
               Pings the JMS service for all instances using the specified
               configuration.

           instance-name
               Pings the JMS service for the specified server instance.
