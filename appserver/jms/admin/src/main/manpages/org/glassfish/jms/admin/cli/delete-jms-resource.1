SYNOPSIS
           delete-jms-resource [--help]
           [--target target]

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-jms-resource subcommand removes the specified Java Message
       Service (JMS) resource. Ensure that you remove all references to this
       resource before executing this subcommand.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only. Remote asadmin
       subcommands require a running domain administration server (DAS).

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Deletes the JMS resource only from the specified target. Valid
           values are as follows:

               Note
               +----------------------------------------+
               |Resources are always created for a      |
               |domain as a whole but are only active   |
               |for targets for which a <resource-ref>  |
               |has been created using the --target     |
               |option when the resource was created.   |
               |This means that deleting a resource     |
               |only deletes the <resource-ref> element |
               |for the specified --target, and does    |
               |not delete the resource from the domain |
               |as a whole unless domain is specified   |
               |as the --target for the deletion.       |
               +----------------------------------------+
