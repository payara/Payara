SYNOPSIS
           delete-jmsdest [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-jmsdest subcommand removes the specified Java Message
       Service (JMS) physical destination.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only. Remote asadmin
       subcommands require a running domain administration server (DAS).

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --desttype
           The type of the JMS destination. Valid values are topic and queue.

       --target
           Deletes the physical destination only from the specified target.
           Although the delete-jmsdest subcommand is related to resources, a
           physical destination is deleted using the JMS Service (JMS Broker),
           which is part of the configuration. A JMS Broker is configured in
           the config section of domain.xml. Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Deletes the physical destination from the default server
               instance. This is the default value.

           configuration-name
               Deletes the physical destination from the specified
               configuration.

           cluster-name
               Deletes the physical destination from every server instance in
               the specified cluster.

           instance-name
               Creates the physical destination from the specified server
               instance.
