DESCRIPTION
       The create-jms-resource subcommand creates a Java Message Service (JMS)
       connection factory resource or a JMS destination resource.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only. Remote asadmin
       subcommands require a running domain administration server (DAS).

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --restype
           The JMS resource type, which can be javax.jms.Topic,
           javax.jms.Queue, javax.jms.ConnectionFactory,
           javax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory, or
           javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory.

       --target
           Creates the JMS resource only for the specified target. Valid
           values are as follows:

               Note
               +----------------------------------------+
               |The resource is always created for the  |
               |domain as a whole, but the              |
               |<resource-ref> element for the resource |
               |is only created for the specified       |
               |--target. This means that although the  |
               |resource is defined at the domain       |
               |level, it is only active at the         |
               |specified --target.                     |
               +----------------------------------------+

           server
               Creates the JMS resource for the default server instance. This
               is the default value.

           domain
               Creates the JMS resource for the domain.

           cluster-name
               Creates the JMS resource for every server instance in the
               specified cluster.

           instance-name
               Creates the JMS resource for the specified server instance.

       --enabled
           If set to true (the default), the resource is enabled at runtime.

       --description
           Text providing details about the JMS resource.

       --property
           Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the JMS
           resource.

           You can specify the following properties for a connection factory
           resource:

           ClientId
               A client ID for a connection factory that will be used by a
               durable subscriber.

           AddressList
               A comma-separated list of message queue addresses that specify
               the host names (and, optionally, port numbers) of a message
               broker instance or instances with which your application will
               communicate. For example, the value could be earth or
               earth:7677. Specify the port number if the message broker is
               running on a port other than the default (7676). composed from
               the JMS hosts defined in the server's JMS service
               configuration. The default value is localhost and the default
               port number is 7676. The client will attempt a connection to a
               broker on port 7676 of the local host.

           UserName
               The user name for the connection factory. The default value is
               guest.

           Password
               The password for the connection factory. The default value is
               guest.

           ReconnectEnabled
               A value of true indicates that the client runtime attempts to
               reconnect to a message server (or the list of addresses in the
               AddressList) when a connection is lost. The default value is
               false.

           ReconnectAttempts
               The number of attempts to connect (or reconnect) for each
               address in the AddressList before the client runtime tries the
               next address in the list. A value of -1 indicates that the
               number of reconnect attempts is unlimited (the client runtime
               attempts to connect to the first address until it succeeds).
               The default value is 6.

           ReconnectInterval
               The interval in milliseconds between reconnect attempts. This
               applies to attempts on each address in the AddressList and for
               successive addresses in the list. If the interval is too short,
               the broker does not have time to recover. If it is too long,
               the reconnect might represent an unacceptable delay. The
               default value is 30,000 milliseconds.

           AddressListBehavior
               Specifies whether connection attempts are in the order of
               addresses in the AddressList (PRIORITY) or in a random order
               (RANDOM).  PRIORITY means that the reconnect will always try to
               connect to the first server address in the AddressList and will
               use another one only if the first broker is not available. If
               you have many clients attempting a connection using the same
               connection factory, specify RANDOM to prevent them from all
               being connected to the same address. The default value is the
               AddressListBehavior value of the server's JMS service
               configuration.

           AddressListIterations
               The number of times the client runtime iterates through the
               AddressList in an effort to establish (or re-establish) a
               connection). A value of -1 indicates that the number of
               attempts is unlimited. The default value is -1.

           Additionally, you can specify connector-connection-pool attributes
           as connector resource properties. For a list of these attributes,
           see "connector-connection-pool" in Oracle GlassFish Server
           Application Deployment Guide.

           You can specify the following properties for a destination
           resource:

           Name
               The name of the physical destination to which the resource will
               refer. The physical destination is created automatically when
               you run an application that uses the destination resource. You
               can also create a physical destination with the create-jmsdest
               subcommand. If you do not specify this property, the JMS
               service creates a physical destination with the same name as
               the destination resource (replacing any forward slash in the
               JNDI name with an underscore).

           Description
               A description of the physical destination.

       --force
           Specifies whether the subcommand overwrites the existing JMS
           resource of the same name. The default value is false.

OPERANDS
       jndi_name
           The JNDI name of the JMS resource to be created.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating a JMS connection factory resource for durable
       subscriptions
           The following subcommand creates a connection factory resource of
           type javax.jms.ConnectionFactory whose JNDI name is
           jms/DurableConnectionFactory. The ClientId property sets a client
           ID on the connection factory so that it can be used for durable
           subscriptions. The JNDI name for a JMS resource customarily
           includes the jms/ naming subcontext.

               asadmin> create-jms-resource --restype javax.jms.ConnectionFactory
               --description "connection factory for durable subscriptions"
               --property ClientId=MyID jms/DurableConnectionFactory
               Connector resource jms/DurableConnectionFactory created.
               Command create-jms-resource executed successfully.

       Example 2, Creating a JMS destination resource
           The following subcommand creates a destination resource whose JNDI
           name is jms/MyQueue. The Name property specifies the physical
           destination to which the resource refers.

               asadmin> create-jms-resource --restype javax.jms.Queue
               --property Name=PhysicalQueue jms/MyQueue
               Administered object jms/MyQueue created.
               Command create-jms-resource executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           subcommand executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the subcommand
