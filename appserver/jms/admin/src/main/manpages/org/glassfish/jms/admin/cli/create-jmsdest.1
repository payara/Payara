NAME
       create-jmsdest - creates a JMS physical destination

SYNOPSIS
           create-jmsdest [--help]
           --desttype dest_type
           [--property (name=value)[:name=value]*]
           [--target target]
           [--force={false|true}]
           dest_name

DESCRIPTION
       The create-jmsdest subcommand creates a Java Message Service (JMS)
       physical destination. Typically, you use the create-jms-resource
       subcommand to create a JMS destination resource that has a Name
       property that specifies the physical destination. The physical
       destination is created automatically when you run an application that
       uses the destination resource. Use the create-jmsdest subcommand if you
       want to create a physical destination with non-default property
       settings.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only. Remote asadmin
       subcommands require a running domain administration server (DAS).

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --desttype
           The type of the JMS destination. Valid values are topic and queue.

       --property
           Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the physical
           destination. You can specify the following properties for a
           physical destination.

           MaxNumMsgs
               The maximum number of unconsumed messages permitted for the
               destination. A value of -1 denotes an unlimited number of
               messages. The default value is -1. For the dead message queue,
               the default value is 1000.

               If the limitBehavior property is set to FLOW_CONTROL, it is
               possible for the specified message limit to be exceeded because
               the broker cannot react quickly enough to stop the flow of
               incoming messages. In such cases, the value specified for
               maxNumMsgs serves as merely a hint for the broker rather than a
               strictly enforced limit.

           MaxBytesPerMsg
               The maximum size, in bytes, of any single message. Rejection of
               a persistent message is reported to the producing client with
               an exception; no notification is sent for non-persistent
               messages.

               The value may be expressed in bytes, kilobytes, or megabytes,
               using the following suffixes:

               b
                   Bytes

               k
                   Kilobytes (1024 bytes)

               m
                   Megabytes (1024 x 1024 = 1,048,576 bytes)

               A value with no suffix is expressed in bytes; a value of -1
               denotes an unlimited message size. The default value is -1.

           MaxTotalMsgBytes
               The maximum total memory, in bytes, for unconsumed messages.
               The default value is -1. The syntax is the same as for
               maxBytesPerMsg. For the dead message queue, the default value
               is 10m.

           LimitBehavior
               The behavior of the message queue broker when the memory-limit
               threshold is reached. Valid values are as follows.

               REJECT_NEWEST
                   Reject newest messages and notify the producing client with
                   an exception only if the message is persistent. This is the
                   default value.

               FLOW_CONTROL
                   Slow the rate at which message producers send messages.

               REMOVE_OLDEST
                   Throw out the oldest messages.

               REMOVE_LOW_PRIORITY
                   Throw out the lowest-priority messages according to age,
                   with no notification to the producing client.

               If the value is REMOVE_OLDEST or REMOVE_LOW_PRIORITY and the
               useDMQ property is set to true, excess messages are moved to
               the dead message queue. For the dead message queue itself, the
               default limit behavior is REMOVE_OLDEST, and the value cannot
               be set to FLOW_CONTROL.

           MaxNumProducers
               The maximum number of message producers for the destination.
               When this limit is reached, no new producers can be created. A
               value of -1 denotes an unlimited number of producers. The
               default value is 100. This property does not apply to the dead
               message queue.

           ConsumerFlowLimit
               The maximum number of messages that can be delivered to a
               consumer in a single batch. A value of -1 denotes an unlimited
               number of messages. The default value is 1000. The client
               runtime can override this limit by specifying a lower value on
               the connection factory object.

               In load-balanced queue delivery, this is the initial number of
               queued messages routed to active consumers before load
               balancing begins.

           UseDMQ
               If set to true, dead messages go to the dead message queue. If
               set to false, dead messages are discarded. The default value is
               true.

           ValidateXMLSchemaEnabled
               If set to true, XML schema validation is enabled for the
               destination. The default value is false.

               When XML validation is enabled, the Message Queue client
               runtime will attempt to validate an XML message against the
               specified XSDs (or against the DTD, if no XSD is specified)
               before sending it to the broker. If the specified schema cannot
               be located or the message cannot be validated, the message is
               not sent, and an exception is thrown.

               This property should be set when a destination is inactive:
               that is, when it has no consumers or producers and when there
               are no messages in the destination. Otherwise the producer must
               reconnect.

           XMLSchemaURIList
               A space-separated list of XML schema document (XSD) URI
               strings. The URIs point to the location of one or more XSDs to
               use for XML schema validation, if validateXMLSchemaEnabled is
               set to true. The default value is null.

               Use double quotes around this value if multiple URIs are
               specified, as in the following example:

                   "http://foo/flap.xsd http://test.com/test.xsd"
               If this property is not set or null and XML validation is
               enabled, XML validation is performed using a DTD specified in
               the XML document. If an XSD is changed as a result of changing
               application requirements, all client applications that produce
               XML messages based on the changed XSD must reconnect to the
               broker.

           To modify the value of these properties, you can use the
           as-install/mq/bin/imqcmd command. See "Physical Destination
           Property Reference" in Oracle GlassFish Server Message Queue
           Administration Guide for more information.

       --target
           Creates the physical destination only for the specified target.
           Although the create-jmsdest subcommand is related to resources, a
           physical destination is created using the JMS Service (JMS Broker),
           which is part of the configuration. A JMS Broker is configured in
           the config section of domain.xml. Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Creates the physical destination for the default server
               instance. This is the default value.

           configuration-name
               Creates the physical destination in the specified
               configuration.

           instance-name
               Creates the physical destination for the specified server
               instance.

       --force
           Specifies whether the subcommand overwrites the existing JMS
           physical destination of the same name. The default value is false.

OPERANDS
       dest_name
           A unique identifier for the JMS destination to be created.
