recover-transactions(1)   asadmin Utility Subcommands  recover-transactions(1)

NAME
       recover-transactions - manually recovers pending transactions

SYNOPSIS
           recover-transactions [--help] [--transactionlogdir transaction_log_dir]
           [--target target_server_name] server_name

DESCRIPTION
       The recover-transactions subcommand manually recovers pending
       transactions.

       For an installation of multiple server instances, you can run the
       recover-transactions subcommand from a surviving server instance to
       recover transactions after a server failure. To use this subcommand in
       this way, the following conditions must be met:

       *   Delegated transaction recovery is disabled.

       *   Transaction logs are stored on a shared file system or in a
           database that is accessible to all server instances.

       For a stand-alone server, do not use this subcommand to recover
       transactions after a server failure. For a stand-alone server, the
       recover-transactions subcommand can recover transactions only when a
       resource fails, but the server is still running. If a stand-alone
       server fails, only the full startup recovery process can recover
       transactions that were pending when the server failed.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --transactionlogdir
           The location of the transaction logs for a server for which
           transaction recovery is requested. This option applies only if
           transaction logs are stored on a shared file system.

       --target
           The target server that performs the recovery for the server that is
           specified by the server_name operand. The target server should be
           running.

       --destination
           This option is deprecated. It works exactly as the --target option
           does.

OPERANDS
       server_name
           For a stand-alone server, the value of this operand is typically
           server. Transactions are recovered only if a resource fails, but
           the server is still running.

           For an installation of multiple server instances, the value of this
           operand is the name of the server for which the recovery is
           required. The in-flight transactions on this server will be
           recovered. If this server is running, recovery is performed by the
           same server. In this situation, the --transactionlogdir and
           --target options should be omitted. If the server is not running,
           the --target option is required, and the --transactionlogdir option
           is also required if transaction logs are stored on a shared file
           system.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Recovering transactions on a running server

               % asadmin recover-transactions server1
               Transaction recovered.

       Example 2, Recovering transactions for a server that is not running

               % asadmin recover-transactions --transactionlogdir /logs/tx --target server1 server2
               Transaction recovered.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
