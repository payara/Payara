/**
 * A <i>RWLock</i> provides concurrency control for multiple readers single writer
 * access patterns. This lock can provide access to multiple reader threads simultaneously
 * as long as there are no writer threads. Once a writer thread gains access to the
 * instance locked by a RWLock, all the reader threads wait till the writer completes
 * accessing the instance in question.
 * <p>
 * A RWLock is extremely useful in scenarios where there are lots more readers and
 * very few writers to a data structure. Also if the read operation by the reader
 * thread could take significant amount of time (binary search etc.)
 * <p>
 * The usage of Lock can be see as under:
 *  <p><hr><blockquote><pre>
 *    public class MyBTree {
 *      private RWLock lock = new Lock();
 *      .....
 *      .....
 *      public Object find(Object o) {
 *        try {
 *          lock.acquireReadLock();
 *          ....perform complex search to get the Object ...
 *          return result;
 *        } finally {
 *          lock.releaseReadLock();
 *        }
 *      }
 *
 *      public void insert(Object o) {
 *        try {
 *          lock.acquireWriteLock();
 *          ....perform complex operation to insert object ...
 *        } finally {
 *          lock.releaseWriteLock();
 *        }
 *      }
 *    }
 * </pre></blockquote><hr>
