freeze-transaction-service(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands  freeze-transaction-service(1)

NAME
       freeze-transaction-service - freezes the transaction subsystem

SYNOPSIS
           freeze-transaction-service [--help] [--target target]

DESCRIPTION
       The freeze-transaction-service subcommand freezes the transaction
       subsystem, preventing the transaction manager from starting,
       completing, or changing the state of all in-flight transactions. Invoke
       this command before rolling back any in-flight transactions. Invoking
       this subcommand on an already frozen transaction subsystem has no
       effect. Restarting the server unfreezes the transaction subsystem. This
       subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           This option specifies the target on which you are freezing the
           transaction service. Valid values are:

           server
               Freezes the transaction service for the default server instance
               server and is the default value.

           configuration_name
               Freezes the transaction service for all server instances that
               use the named configuration.

           cluster_name
               Freezes the transaction service for every server instance in
               the cluster.

           instance_name
               Freezes the transaction service for a particular server
               instance.
