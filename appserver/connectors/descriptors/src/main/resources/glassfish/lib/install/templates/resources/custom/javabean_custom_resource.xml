    Template file to create JavaBean custom resources.
    By specifying the "factory-class-name" for creating java-bean
    and the values for the bean-properties using "properties" of the
    custom-resource, applications can lookup java-bean via JNDI.

    To learn more on custom resources,refer :

    http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-2554/ablld?l=en&a=view
    
    http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-4332/create-custom-resource-1?a=view

    http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-4332/list-custom-resources-1?a=view 

    For detailed explanation of attributes and elements of this resources xml
    pl. refer to sun-resources_1_3.dtd


    =========================================SAMPLE============================================


    In the sample configuration below, 
    JavaBean org.glassfish.resource.custom.test.Customer
    has attributes (along with getters and setters)

    To initialize the JavaBean with values, set the property name and the value.
    Applications can do  :

    (CustomResourceJavaBean)initialContext.lookup("custom/my-java-bean")

    to get the bean instance that is populated with customerId, customerLocation, customerSince attributes

    Following command will create a resource using this template :

    GLASSFISH_INSTALL_DIR/bin/asadmin add-resources <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_TEMPLATE_FILE>


    <resources>
        <custom-resource res-type="org.glassfish.resource.custom.test.Customer" jndi-name="custom/my-java-bean" 
         factory-class="org.glassfish.resources.custom.factory.JavaBeanFactory">
          <property name="customerId" value="cu-101" />
          <property name="customerLocation" value="San Francisco" />
          <property name="customerSince" value="1990" />
        </custom-resource>
    </resources>
