    Template file to create Primitive Types or String Object provider custom resources.
    By specifying the built-in "factory-class" as 
    org.glassfish.resources.custom.factory.PrimitivesAndStringFactory, 
    "res-type" (short/int/long/float/double/char/byte/String)
    and a property named "value" with the required value, a custom-resource can be created 
    that can be used by applications.

    To learn more on custom resources,refer :

    http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-2554/ablld?l=en&a=view
    
    http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-4332/create-custom-resource-1?a=view

    http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-4332/list-custom-resources-1?a=view 

    For detailed explanation of attributes and elements of this resources xml
    pl. refer to sun-resources_1_3.dtd


    =========================================SAMPLE============================================


    In the sample configuration below, 
    custom-resource will provide a long (java.lang.Long) upon lookup

    Applications can do  :

    (java.lang.Long)initialContext.lookup("custom/my-primitive-long")


    Following command will create a resource using this template :

    GLASSFISH_INSTALL_DIR/bin/asadmin add-resources <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_TEMPLATE_FILE>


    <resources>
        <custom-resource res-type="long" jndi-name="custom/my-primitive-long" 
         factory-class="org.glassfish.resources.custom.factory.PrimitivesAndStringFactory">
          <property name="value" value="2008" />
        </custom-resource>
    </resources>
