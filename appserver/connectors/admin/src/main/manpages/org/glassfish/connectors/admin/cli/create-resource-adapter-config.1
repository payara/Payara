NAME
       create-resource-adapter-config - creates the configuration information
       for the connector module

SYNOPSIS
           create-resource-adapter-config [--help] [--threadpoolid threadpool]

           raname

DESCRIPTION
       The create-resource-adapter-config subcommand creates configuration
       information for the connector module. This subcommand can be run before
       deploying a resource adapter, so that the configuration information is
       available at the time of deployment. The resource adapter configuration
       can also be created after the resource adapter is deployed. In this
       case, the resource adapter is restarted with the new configuration. You
       must first create a thread pool, using the create-threadpool
       subcommand, and then identify that thread pool value as the ID in the
       --threadpoolid option.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --threadpoolid
           The thread pool ID from which the work manager gets the thread.
           This option takes only one thread pool ID.

       --objecttype
           The default is user.

       --property
           Keyword-value pairs that specify additional configuration
           properties of the resource adapter Java bean. The keyword-value
           pairs are separated by a colon (:). The properties are the names of
           setter methods of the class that is referenced by the
           resourceadapter-class element in the ra.xml file.

OPERANDS
       raname
           Indicates the connector module name. It is the value of the
           resource-adapter-name in the domain.xml file.
