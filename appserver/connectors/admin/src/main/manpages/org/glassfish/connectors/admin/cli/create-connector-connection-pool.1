DESCRIPTION
       The create-connector-connection-pool subcommand defines a pool of
       connections to an enterprise information system (EIS). The named pool
       can be referred to by multiple connector resources. Each defined pool
       is instantiated at server startup, and is populated when accessed for
       the first time. If two or more connector resources point to the same
       connector connection pool, they are using the same pool of connections
       at run time. There can be more than one pool for a connection
       definition in a single resource adapter.

       A connector connection pool with authentication can be created either
       by using a --property option to specify user, password, or other
       connection information, or by specifying the connection information in
       the XML descriptor file.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --associatewiththread
           Specifies whether a connection is associated with the thread to
           enable the thread to reuse the connection. If a connection is not
           associated with the thread, the thread must obtain a connection
           from the pool each time that the thread requires a connection.
           Possible values are as follows:

           false
               A connection is not associated with the thread (default).

           true
               A connection is associated with the thread.

       --connectiondefinition
           The name of the connection definition.

       --creationretryattempts
           Specifies the maximum number of times that the server retries to
           create a connection if the initial attempt fails.

           Default value is 0, which specifies that the server does not retry
           to create the connection.

       --creationretryinterval
           Specifies the interval, in seconds, between successive attempts to
           create a connection.

           If --creationretryattempts is 0, the --creationretryinterval option
           is ignored. Default value is 10.

       --description
           Text providing descriptive details about the connector connection
           pool.

       --failconnection
           If set to true, all connections in the pool are closed if a single
           validation check fails. This parameter is mandatory if the
           --isconnectvalidatereq option is set to true. Default value is
           false.

       --idletimeout
           The maximum time that a connection can remain idle in the pool.
           After this amount of time, the pool can close this connection.
           Default value is 300.

       --isconnectvalidatereq
           If the value is set to true, the connections will be checked to see
           if they are usable, before they are given out to the application.
           Default value is false.

       --lazyconnectionenlistment
           Specifies whether a resource to a transaction is enlisted only when
           a method actually uses the resource. Default value is false.

       --lazyconnectionassociation
           Specifies whether a physical connection should be associated with
           the logical connection only when the physical connection is used,
           and disassociated when the transaction is completed. Such
           association and dissociation enable the reuse of physical
           connections. Possible values are as follows:

           false
               A physical connection is associated with the logical connection
               even before the physical connection is used, and is not
               disassociated when the transaction is completed (default).

           true
               A physical connection is associated with the logical connection
               only when the physical connection is used, and disassociated
               when the transaction is completed. The
               --lazyconnectionenlistment option must also be set to true.

       --leakreclaim
           Specifies whether leaked connections are restored to the connection
           pool after leak connection tracing is complete. Possible values are
           as follows:

           false
               Leaked connections are not restored to the connection pool
               (default).

           true
               Leaked connections are restored to the connection pool.

       --leaktimeout
           Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, for which connection
           leaks in a connection pool are to be traced.

           If connection leak tracing is enabled, you can use the
           Administration Console to enable monitoring of the JDBC connection
           pool to get statistics on the number of connection leaks. Default
           value is 0, which disables connection leak tracing.

       --matchconnections
           Specifies whether a connection that is selected from the pool
           should be matched with the resource adaptor. If all connections in
           the pool are identical, matching between connections and resource
           adapters is not required. Possible values are as follows:

           true
               A connection should be matched with the resource adaptor
               (default).

           false
               A connection should not be matched with the resource adaptor.

       --maxconnectionusagecount
           Specifies the maximum number of times that a connection can be
           reused.

           When this limit is reached, the connection is closed. Default value
           is 0, which specifies no limit on the number of times that a
           connection can be reused.

       --maxpoolsize
           The maximum number of connections that can be created to satisfy
           client requests. Default value is 32.

       --maxwait
           The amount of time, in milliseconds, that a caller must wait before
           a connection is created, if a connection is not available. If set
           to 0, the caller is blocked indefinitely until a resource is
           available or until an error occurs. Default value is 60000.

       --ping
           A pool with this attribute set to true is contacted during creation
           (or reconfiguration) to identify and warn of any erroneous values
           for its attributes. Default value is false.

       --pooling
           When set to false, this attribute disables connection pooling.
           Default value is true.

       --poolresize
           Quantity by which the pool will scale up or scale down the number
           of connections. Scale up: When the pool has no free connections,
           pool will scale up by this quantity. Scale down: All the invalid
           and idle connections are removed, sometimes resulting in removing
           connections of quantity greater than this value. The number of
           connections that is specified by --steadypoolsize will be ensured.
           Possible values are from 0 to MAX_INTEGER. Default value is 2.

       --property
           Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the pool.

           LazyConnectionEnlistment
               Deprecated. Use the equivalent option. Default value is false.

           LazyConnectionAssociation
               Deprecated. Use the equivalent option. Default value is false.

           AssociateWithThread
               Deprecated. Use the equivalent option. Default value is false.

           MatchConnections
               Deprecated. Use the equivalent option. Default value is false.

       --raname
           The name of the resource adapter.

       --steadypoolsize
           The minimum and initial number of connections maintained in the
           pool. Default value is 8.

       --target
           Do not specify this option. This option is retained for
           compatibility with earlier releases. If you specify this option, a
           syntax error does not occur. Instead, the subcommand runs
           successfully and displays a warning message that the option is
           ignored.

       --transactionsupport
           Indicates the level of transaction support that this pool will
           have. Possible values are XATransaction, LocalTransaction and
           NoTransaction. This attribute can have a value lower than or equal
           to but not higher than the resource adapter's transaction support
           attribute. The resource adapter's transaction support attribute has
           an order of values, where XATransaction is the highest, and
           NoTransaction the lowest.

       --validateatmostonceperiod
           Specifies the time interval in seconds between successive requests
           to validate a connection at most once. Setting this attribute to an
           appropriate value minimizes the number of validation requests by a
           connection. Default value is 0, which means that the attribute is
           not enabled.
