flush-connection-pool(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands flush-connection-pool(1)

NAME
       flush-connection-pool - reintializes all connections established in the
       specified connection pool

SYNOPSIS
           flush-connection-pool [--help] pool_name
           [--appname application [--modulename module]

DESCRIPTION
       The flush-connection-pool subcommand resets a JDBC connection pool or a
       connector connection pool to its initial state. Any existing live
       connections are destroyed, which means that the transactions associated
       with these connections are lost. The subcommand then recreates the
       initial connections for the pool, and restores the pool to its steady
       pool size.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

   Application Scoped Resources
       The flush-connection-pool subcommand can target resources that are
       scoped to a specific application or module, as defined in the
       glassfish-resources.xml for the GlassFish domain.

       *   To reference the jndi-name for an application scoped resource,
           perform the lookup using the java:app prefix.

       *   To reference the jndi-name for a module scoped resource, perform
           the lookup using the java:module prefix.

       The jndi-name for application-scoped-resources or
       module-scoped-resources are specified using the format
       java:app/jdbc/myDataSource or java:module/jdbc/myModuleLevelDataSource.
       This naming scope is defined in the Java EE 8 Specification
       (https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/).
