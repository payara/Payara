DESCRIPTION
       The delete-custom-resource subcommand removes a custom resource.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           This option helps specify the location of the custom resources that
           you are deleting. Valid targets are server, domain, and
           instance. The default is server.

               Note
               +----------------------------------------+
               |Resources are always created for a      |
               |domain as a whole but are only active   |
               |for targets for which a <resource-ref>  |
               |has been created using the --target     |
               |option when the resource was created.   |
               |This means that deleting a resource     |
               |only deletes the <resource-ref> element |
               |for the specified --target, and does    |
               |not delete the resource from the domain |
               |as a whole unless domain is specified   |
               |as the --target for the deletion.       |
               +----------------------------------------+
