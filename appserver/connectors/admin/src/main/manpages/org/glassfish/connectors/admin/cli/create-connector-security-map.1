create-connector-security-map(1) asadmin Utility Subcommands  create-connector-security-map(1)

NAME
       create-connector-security-map - creates a security map for the
       specified connector connection pool

SYNOPSIS
           create-connector-security-map [--help]
           --poolname connector_connection_pool_name
           [--principals principal-name1[,principal-name2]*]
           [--usergroups user-group1[,user-group2]*]
           [--mappedusername user-name]
           [--target target]
           mapname

DESCRIPTION
       The create-connector-security-map subcommand creates a security map for
       the specified connector connection pool. If the security map is not
       present, a new one is created. This subcommand can also map the caller
       identity of the application (principal or user group) to a suitable
       enterprise information system (EIS) principal in container-managed
       authentication scenarios. The EIS is any system that holds the data of
       an organization. It can be a mainframe, a messaging system, a database
       system, or an application. One or more named security maps can be
       associated with a connector connection pool. The connector security map
       configuration supports the use of the wild card asterisk (*) to
       indicate all users or all user groups.

       To specify the EIS password, you can add the AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD
       entry to the password file, then specify the file by using the
       --passwordfile asadmin utility option.

       For this subcommand to succeed, you must have first created a connector
       connection pool using the create-connector-connection-pool subcommand.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --poolname
           Specifies the name of the connector connection pool to which the
           security map belongs.

       --principals
           Specifies a list of backend EIS principals. More than one principal
           can be specified using a comma-separated list. Use either the
           --principals or --usergroups options, but not both in the same
           command.

       --usergroups
           Specifies a list of backend EIS user group. More than one user
           groups can be specified using a comma separated list. Use either
           the --principals or --usergroups options, but not both in the same
           command.

       --mappedusername
           Specifies the EIS username.

       --target
           Do not specify this option. This option is retained for
           compatibility with earlier releases. If you specify this option, a
           syntax error does not occur. Instead, the subcommand runs
           successfully and displays a warning message that the option is
           ignored.

OPERANDS
       mapname
           The name of the security map to be created.
