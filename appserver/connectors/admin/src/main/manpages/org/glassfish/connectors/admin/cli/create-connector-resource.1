DESCRIPTION
       The create-connector-resource subcommand registers the connector
       resource with the specified JNDI name.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --poolname
           The name of the connection pool. When two or more resource elements
           point to the same connection pool element, they use the same pool
           connections at runtime.

       --enabled
           This option determines whether the resource is enabled at runtime.
           The default value is true.

       --objecttype
           Defines the type of the connector resource. Default is user.
           Allowed values are:

           system-all
               A system resource for all server instances and the domain
               administration server (DAS).

           system-admin
               A system resource only for the DAS.

           system-instance
               A system resource for all server instances only.

           user
               A user resource.

       --description
           Text providing details about the connector resource.

       --property
           Optional attribute name value pairs for configuring the resource.

       --target
           This option specifies the ending location of the connector
           resources. Valid targets are:

           server
               Creates the connector resource in the default server instance.
               This is the default value.

           domain
               Creates the connector resource in the domain.

           cluster_name
               Creates the connector resource in every server instance in the
               cluster.

           instance_name
               Creates the connector resource in the specified server
               instance.

               Note
               +----------------------------------------+
               |The resource is always created for the  |
               |domain as a whole, but the resource-ref |
               |for the resource is only created for    |
               |the specified --target. This means that |
               |although the resource is defined at the |
               |domain level, it is only available at   |
               |the specified target level. Use the     |
               |create-resource-ref subcommand to refer |
               |to the resource in multiple targets if  |
               |needed.                                 |
               +----------------------------------------+

               asadmin> create-connector-resource --poolname jms/qConnPool
               --description "sample connector resource" jms/qConnFactory
               Command create-connector-resource executed successfully

       Example 2, Using the create-connector-resource subcommand
           This example shows the usage of this subcommand.

               asadmin> create-connector-resource --target server --poolname jms/qConnPool
               --description "sample connector resource" jms/qConnFactory
               Command create-connector-resource executed successfully
           Where jms/qConnFactory is the sample connector resource that is
           created.
