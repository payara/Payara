               Note
               +----------------------------------------+
               |Resources are always created for a      |
               |domain as a whole but are only active   |
               |for targets for which a <resource-ref>  |
               |has been created using the --target     |
               |option when the resource was created.   |
               |This means that deleting a resource     |
               |only deletes the <resource-ref> element |
               |for the specified --target, and does    |
               |not delete the resource from the domain |
               |as a whole unless domain is specified   |
               |as the --target for the deletion.       |
