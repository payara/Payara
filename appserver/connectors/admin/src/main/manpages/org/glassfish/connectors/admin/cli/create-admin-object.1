       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target on which you are creating the administered
           object. Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Creates the administered object for the default server instance
               server and is the default value.

           configuration_name
               Creates the administered object for the named configuration.

           cluster_name
               Creates the administered object for every server instance in
               the cluster.

           instance_name
               Creates the administered object for a particular server
               instance.

               Note
               +----------------------------------------+
               |The resource is always created for the  |
               |domain as a whole, but the resource-ref |
               |for the resource is only created for    |
               |the specified --target. This means that |
               |although the resource is defined at the |
               |domain level, it is only available at   |
               |the specified target level. Use the     |
               |create-resource-ref subcommand to refer |
               |to the resource in multiple targets if  |
               |needed.                                 |
               +----------------------------------------+

           the ra.xml file of the resource adapter.

       --classname
           Specifies the class name of the administered object. Required if
           multiple administered objects use the same interface definition.

           Specifies the name of the resource adapter associated with this
           administered object.
