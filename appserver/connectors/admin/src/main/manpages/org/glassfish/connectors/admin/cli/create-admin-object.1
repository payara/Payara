DESCRIPTION
       The create-admin-object subcommand creates the administered object with
       the specified JNDI name and the interface definition for a resource
       adapter.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target on which you are creating the administered
           object. Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Creates the administered object for the default server instance
               server and is the default value.

           configuration_name
               Creates the administered object for the named configuration.

           instance_name
               Creates the administered object for a particular server
               instance.

               Note
               +----------------------------------------+
               |The resource is always created for the  |
               |domain as a whole, but the resource-ref |
               |for the resource is only created for    |
               |the specified --target. This means that |
               |although the resource is defined at the |
               |domain level, it is only available at   |
               |the specified target level. Use the     |
               |create-resource-ref subcommand to refer |
               |to the resource in multiple targets if  |
               |needed.                                 |
               +----------------------------------------+

       --restype

           the ra.xml file of the resource adapter.

       --classname
           Specifies the class name of the administered object. Required if
           multiple administered objects use the same interface definition.

       --raname
           Specifies the name of the resource adapter associated with this
           administered object.
