DESCRIPTION
       The delete-connector-connection-pool subcommand removes the specified
       connector connection pool.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Do not specify this option. This option is retained for
           compatibility with earlier releases. If you specify this option, a
           syntax error does not occur. Instead, the subcommand runs
           successfully and displays a warning message that the option is
           ignored.

       --cascade
           When set to true, all connector resources associated with the pool,
           and the pool itself, are deleted. When set to false, the deletion
           of pool fails if any resources are associated with the pool. The
           resource must be deleted explicitly or the option must be set to
           true. Default is false.

OPERANDS
       poolname
           The name of the connection pool to be removed.
