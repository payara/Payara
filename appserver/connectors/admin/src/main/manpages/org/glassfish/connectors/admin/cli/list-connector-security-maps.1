NAME
       list-connector-security-maps - lists the security maps belonging to the
       specified connector connection pool

SYNOPSIS
           list-connector-security-maps [--help] [--securitymap securitymap]
           [--verbose={false|true}] [--target target]
           pool-name

DESCRIPTION
       The list-connector-security-maps subcommand lists the security maps
       belonging to the specified connector connection pool.

       For this subcommand to succeed, you must have first created a connector
       connection pool using the create-connector-connection-pool subcommand.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --securitymap
           Specifies the name of the security map contained within the
           connector connection pool from which the identity and principals
           should be listed. With this option, --verbose is redundant.

       --verbose
           If set to true, returns a list including the identity, principals,
           and security name. The default is false.

       --target
           Do not specify this option. This option is retained for
           compatibility with earlier releases. If you specify this option, a
           syntax error does not occur. Instead, the subcommand runs
           successfully and displays a warning message that the option is
           ignored.

OPERANDS
       pool-name
           Name of the connector connection pool for which you want to list
           security maps.
