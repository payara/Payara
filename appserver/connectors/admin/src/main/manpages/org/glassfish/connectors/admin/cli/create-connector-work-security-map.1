NAME
       create-connector-work-security-map - creates a work security map for
       the specified resource adapter

SYNOPSIS
           create-connector-work-security-map [--help] --raname raname
           [--principalsmap eis-principal1=principal_name1[, eis-principal2=principal_name2]*
           |--groupsmap eis-group1=server-group1[, eis-group2=server-group2]*}
           [--description description]
           mapname

DESCRIPTION
       The create-connector-work-security-map subcommand maps the caller
       identity of the work submitted by the resource adapter EIS principal or
       EIS user group to a suitable principal or user group in the GlassFish
       Server security domain. One or more work security maps may be
       associated with a resource adapter. The connector work security map
       configuration supports the use of the wild card asterisk (*) to
       indicate all users or all user groups.

       The enterprise information system (EIS) is any system that holds the
       data of an organization. It can be a mainframe, a messaging system, a
       database system, or an application.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating a Connector Work Security Map (Principal)
           This example creates connector work security map workSecurityMap1
           that maps the backend EIS principal to the GlassFish Server
           principal.

               asadmin create-connector-work-security-map --raname my-resource-adapter
               --principalsmap eis-principal-1=server-principal-1,eis-principal-2
               =server-principal-2,eis-principal-3=server-principal-1
               workSecurityMap1
               Command create-connector-work-security-map executed successfully.

       Example 2, Creating a Connector Work Security Map (Group)
           This example creates connector work security map workSecurityMap2
           that maps the backend EIS user group to the GlassFish Server user
           group.

               asadmin create-connector-work-security-map --raname my-resource-adapter
               --groupsmap eis-group-1=server-group-1,eis-group-2=server-group-2,
               eis-group-3=server-group-1 workSecurityMap2
               Command create-connector-work-security-map executed successfully.
