NAME
       create-custom-resource - creates a custom resource

SYNOPSIS
           create-custom-resource [--help] --restype type --factoryclass classname
           [--enabled={true|false}] [--description text]
           [--property (name=value)[:name=value]*] jndi-name
           [--target target]

DESCRIPTION
       The create-custom-resource subcommand creates a custom resource. A
       custom resource specifies a custom server-wide resource object factory
       that implements the javax.naming.spi.ObjectFactory interface.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           The target on which the custom resource you are creating will be
           available. Valid values are:

           server
               The resource will be available on the default server instance
               and all domains hosted on the instance. This is the default
               value.

           domain
               The resource will be available on the specified domain only.

           cluster_name
               The resource will be available on every server instance in the
               cluster.

           instance_name
               The resource will be available on the specified server instance
               only.

               Note
               +----------------------------------------+
               |The resource is always created for the  |
               |domain as a whole, but the resource-ref |
               |for the resource is only created for    |
               |the specified --target. This means that |
               |although the resource is defined at the |
               |domain level, it is only available at   |
               |the specified target level. Use the     |
               |create-resource-ref subcommand to refer |
               |to the resource in multiple targets if  |
               |needed.                                 |
               +----------------------------------------+
