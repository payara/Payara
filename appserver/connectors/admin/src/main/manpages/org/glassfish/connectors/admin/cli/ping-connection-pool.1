ping-connection-pool(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands  ping-connection-pool(1)

NAME
       ping-connection-pool - tests if a connection pool is usable

SYNOPSIS
           ping-connection-pool [--help] pool_name
           [--appname application [--modulename module]

DESCRIPTION
       The ping-connection-pool subcommand tests if an existing JDBC or
       connector connection pool is usable . For example, if you create a new
       JDBC connection pool for an application that is expected to be deployed
       later, the JDBC pool is tested with this subcommand before deploying
       the application.

       Before testing availability of a connection pool, you must create the
       connection pool with authentication and ensure that the server or
       database is started.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

   Application Scoped Resources
       The ping-connection-pool subcommand can target resources that are
       scoped to a specific application or module, as defined in the
       glassfish-resources.xml for the GlassFish domain.

       *   To reference the jndi-name for an application scoped resource,
           perform the lookup using the java:app prefix.

       *   To reference the jndi-name for a module scoped resource, perform
           the lookup using the java:module prefix.

       The jndi-name for application-scoped-resources or
       module-scoped-resources are specified using the format
       java:app/jdbc/myDataSource or java:module/jdbc/myModuleLevelDataSource.
       This naming scope is defined in the Java EE 6 Specification
       (http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/).
