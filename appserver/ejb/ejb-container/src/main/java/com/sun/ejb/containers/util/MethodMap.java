/**
 * This is an optimized map for resolving java.lang.reflect.Method objects.
 * Doing a method lookup, even on an unsynchronized Map, can be an 
 * expensive operation, in many cases taking multiple microseconds.
 * In most situations this overhead is negligible, but it can be noticeable
 * when performed in the common path of a local ejb invocation, where our
 * goal is to be as fast as a raw java method call.  
 *
 * A MethodMap must be created with an existing Map and is immutable after
 * construction(except for clear()).  
 * It does not support the optional Map operations
 * put, putAll, and remove.  NOTE that these operations could
 * be implemented but are not necessary at this point since the main use
 * is for the container's method info, which is invariant after initialization.
 * 
 * As this is a map for Method objects, null keys are not supported.
 * This map is unsynchronized.
