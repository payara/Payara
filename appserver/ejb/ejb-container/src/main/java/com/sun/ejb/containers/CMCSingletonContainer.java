     *  unlocked on all paths in this method.

     * Even though the method doesn't unlock the (possibly) acquired
     * lock, the lock is guaranteed to be unlocked in releaseContext()
     * even in the presence of (both checked and unchecked) exceptions.
     *
     * The general pattern used by various parts of the EJB container code is:
     *
     * try {
     *      container.preInvoke(inv);
     *      returnValue = container.intercept(inv);
     * } catch (Exception1 e1) {
     *      ...
     * } catch (Exception2 e2) {
     *      ...
     * } finally {
     *      container.postInvoke();
     * }
     *
     * Thus, it is clear that, BaseContainer.postInvoke() which in turn
     * calls releaseContext() will be called if container.preInvoke()
     * is called. This ensures that CMCSingletonContainer (this class)
     * releases the lock acquired by _getContext().
     *
     * Also, note that the above works even for loopback methods as
     * container.preInvoke() and container,postInvoke() will be called
     * before every bean method.
