/**
 * A Container stores EJB instances and is responsible for
 * the lifecycle, state management, concurrency, transactions, security,
 * naming, resource management, etc.
 * It does the above by interposing actions before
 * and after invocations on EJBs.
 * It uses the ProtocolManager, SecurityManager, TransactionManager,
 * NamingManager for help with the above responsibilities.
 * There are four types of Containers:
 * StatefulSessionContainer, StatelessSessionContainer,
 * EntityContainer, and MessageBeanContainer.
 * Note: the term "Container" here refers
 * to an instance of one of the above container classes.
 * In the EJB spec "container" refers to a process or JVM which
 * hosts EJB instances.
 * <p>
 * There is one instance of the Container for each EJB type (deployment desc).
 * When a JAR is deployed on the EJB server, a Container instance is created 
 * for each EJB declared in the ejb-jar.xml for the EJB JAR.
 * <p>
 * The Container interface provides methods called from other parts of
 * the RI as well as from generated EJBHome/EJBObject implementations.
