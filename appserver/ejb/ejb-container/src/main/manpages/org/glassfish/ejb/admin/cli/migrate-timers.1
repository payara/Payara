migrate-timers(1)         asadmin Utility Subcommands        migrate-timers(1)

NAME
       migrate-timers - moves EJB timers when an instance was stopped
       or has crashed

SYNOPSIS
           migrate-timers [--help] [--target target_server_name]
            server_name

DESCRIPTION
       The migrate-timers subcommand moves EJB timers to a specified server
       when a server instance stops or crashes, if automatic timer migration
       is not enabled in the instance configuration. This subcommand is
       supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           This is the target server instance. If this option is not
           specified, then DAS will find a server instance or multiple server
           instances. A migration notification will be sent to the selected
           server instances.

       --destination
           This option is deprecated. It works exactly as the --target option
           does.

OPERANDS
       server_name
           This is the server instance on which the timers are currently
           located. This server instance should not be running during the
           migration process.
