containers.mdb.create_container_exception=MDB00017: [{0}]: Exception in creating message-driven bean container: [{1}]
MDB00017.diag.cause.1=An error occurred during the message-driven bean container initialization at runtime.  The most common cause for this is that the physical resource(e.g. Queue) from which the message-driven bean is consuming either does not exist or has been configured incorrectly.  Another common error is that the message-driven bean implementation class does not correctly implement the required javax.ejb.MessageBean or MessageListener interfaces.
MDB00017.diag.check.1=Double-check that the JNDI name of the message-driven bean's resource in sun-ejb-jar.xml is correct.  It is also useful to run the verifier to check that the code requirements for the message-driven bean class have been fulfilled.

containers.mdb.preinvoke_exception=MDB00048: Message-driven bean [{0}]: Exception in preinvoke : [{1}]
MDB00048.diag.cause.1=An error occurred during the pre-invocation processing before a message-driven bean MessageListener method is called.  This is often caused by some transaction-related errors. 
MDB00048.diag.check.1=Double-check the transaction configuration for the message-driven bean and consult stack trace for additional details.
containers.mdb.postinvoke_exception=MDB00049: Message-driven bean [{0}]: Exception in postinvoke : [{1}]
containers.mdb.ejb_creation_exception=MDB00050: Message-driven bean [{0}]: Exception in creating message-driven ejb : [{1}]
MDB00050.diag.cause.1=An error occurred during the lifecycle initialization of a message-driven bean instance.  This typically means a system exception was thrown from the bean code during the execution of the no-arg constructor, the setMessageDrivenContext method, or the ejbCreate method.  Common causes are failed naming service lookups coding errors, or ClassNotFound errors.
MDB00050.diag.check.1=Check the stack trace to see which method threw the exception.  If the error was caused by a NamingException, double-check the environment configuration (ejb-refs, resource-refs, etc.) in the deployment descriptor against the coded names.  It would also be useful to run the verifier.
containers.mdb_preinvoke_exception_indestroy=MDB00051: Message-driven bean [{0}] preinvoke exception in destroy message-driven ejb: [{1}]
MDB00051.diag.cause.1=An error occurred while the container was destroying an instance of a message-driven bean.  The most common cause is that a message-driven bean class threw a system exception from its ejbRemove method.
MDB00051.diag.check.1=Check the message driven bean's ejbRemove implementation to determine what would result in an exception.  Also consult the stack trace for more information.
containers.mdb.start_message_delivery_exception=MDB00052: Message-driven bean [{0}]: start message delivery exception: [{1}]
MDB00052.diag.cause.1=An error occurred while the container was enabling the message flow into a message-driven bean.  This is an internal error that typically means there is a problem with the messaging system from which the message-driven bean is consuming.
MDB00052.diag.check.1=Check the stack trace for more details.
containers.mdb.cleanup_exception=MDB00053: Message-driven bean [{0}] container cleanup exception: [{1}]
containers.mdb.set_beancontext_exception=MDB00054: Message-driven bean [{0}]: Exception setting bean context : [{1}]
