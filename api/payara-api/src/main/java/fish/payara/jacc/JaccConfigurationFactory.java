/**
 * An alternative interface for Payara's {@link PolicyConfigurationFactory} that allows to install
 * a local (per application) Jacc Provider (authorization module).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that this only works with Payara's default PolicyConfigurationFactory and not with any replacement
 * global PolicyConfigurationFactory. It may be possible to make such replacement PolicyConfigurationFactory
 * support installing local Jacc Providers by letting it implement this interface.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Installing a local Jacc provider is only supported for a web module, and thus not for an EJB module. A future
 * version of this interface may support EJB modules.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A local Jacc provider can be installed using a {@link ServletContextListener} as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * &#64;WebListener
 *public class JaccInstaller implements ServletContextListener {
 * 
 *  &#64;Override
 *  public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent sce) {
 *      JaccConfigurationFactory.getJaccConfigurationFactory()
 *                              .registerContextProvider(
 *                                      getAppContextId(sce.getServletContext()),
 *                                      new TestPolicyConfigurationFactory(), 
 *                                      new TestPolicy());
 *  }
 * 
 *  private String getAppContextId(ServletContext servletContext) {
 *      return servletContext.getVirtualServerName() + " " + servletContext.getContextPath();
 *  }
