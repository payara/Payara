We have added full JCache support, enhanced JBatch functionality, replaced Shoal with Hazelcast for session clustering and are driving development of Payara Micro. A completely new way of running war applications on top of an embedded GlassFish core. Payara Micro is ideally suited to cloud and microservice architectures with elastic clustering and no installation. Payara Micro can run war applications simply using

```Shell

```
