Payara Server is a drop in replacement for GlassFish Server Open Source with the peace of mind of quarterly releases containing enhancements, bug fixes and patches including patches to dependent libraries, as required, including Tyrus, Eclipse Link, Jersey and others. Our vision is to optimise Payara Server and make it the best server for production Java applications with responsive 24/7 dedicated incident and software support from the best middleware engineers in the industry.

We have added full JCache support, enhanced JBatch functionality, replaced Shoal with Hazelcast for session clustering and are driving development of Payara Micro. A completely new way of running war applications on top of an embedded GlassFish core. Payara Micro is ideally suited to cloud and microservice architectures with elastic clustering and no installation. Payara Micro can run war applications simply using

```Shell
