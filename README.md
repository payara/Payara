Payara Server is a drop in replacement for GlassFish Server with the peace of mind of quarterly releases containing enhancements, bug fixes and patches to upstream GlassFish Server and dependent libraries including Tyrus, Eclipse Link, Jersey and others. Our vision is to optimise Payara Server and make it the best server for production Java EE applications with responsive 24/7 dedicated incident and software support from the best middleware engineers in the industry.

At the same time we are focused on enhancing Payara Server with features over base GlassFish Server. We have added full JCache support, enhanced JBatch functionality, replaced Shoal with Hazelcast for session clustering and are driving development of Payara Micro. A completely new way of running Java EE applications on top of the Java EE 7 compatible GlassFish core. Payara Micro is ideally suited to cloud and microservice architectures with elastic clustering and no installation. Payara Micro can run Java EE web profile applications simply using

```Shell
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deploy test.war
```
