NAME
       restart-local-instance - restarts a running GlassFish Server instance
       on the host where the subcommand is run

SYNOPSIS
           restart-local-instance [--help]
           [--nodedir nodedir] [--node node]
           [--debug={false|true}]
           [--force={true|false}] [--kill={false|true}]
           [instance-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The restart-local-instance subcommand restarts a GlassFish Server
       instance on the host where the subcommand is run. This subcommand does
       not require secure shell (SSH) to be configured. You must run this
       command from the host where the instance resides.

       The subcommand can restart any GlassFish Server instance, regardless of
       how the instance was created. For example, this subcommand can restart
       an instance that was created by using the create-instance(1)
       subcommand.

       The restart-local-instance subcommand does not contact the domain
       administration server (DAS) to determine the node on which the instance
       resides. To determine the node on which the instance resides, the
       subcommand searches the directory that contains the node directories.
       If multiple node directories exist, the node must be specified as an
       option of the subcommand.

       When this subcommand restarts an instance, the DAS synchronizes the
       instance with changes since the last synchronization as follows:

       *   For the config directory, the DAS synchronizes the instance with
           all changes.

       *   For the applications directory and docroot directory, only a change
           to a top-level subdirectory causes the DAS to synchronize all files
           under that subdirectory.

           If a file below a top level subdirectory is changed without a
           change to a file in the top level subdirectory, full
           synchronization is required. In normal operation, files below the
           top level subdirectories of these directories are not changed. If
           an application is deployed and undeployed, full synchronization is
           not necessary to update the instance with the change.

       If different synchronization behavior is required, the instance must be
       stopped and restarted by using following sequence of subcommands:

        1. stop-local-instance(1)

        2. start-local-instance(1)

       This subcommand is supported in local mode. However, to synchronize the
       instance with the DAS, this subcommand must be run in remote mode.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --nodedir
           Specifies the directory that contains the instance's node
           directory. The instance's files are stored in the instance's node
           directory. The default is as-install/nodes.

       --node
           Specifies the node on which the instance resides. This option may
           be omitted only if the directory that the --nodedir option
           specifies contains only one node directory. Otherwise, this option
           is required.

       --debug
           Specifies whether the instance is restarted with Java Platform
           Debugger Architecture (JPDA)

           (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/jpda-141715.html)

           debugging enabled.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The instance is restarted with JPDA debugging enabled and the
               port number for JPDA debugging is displayed.

           false
               The instance is restarted with JPDA debugging disabled
               (default).

           The default is the current setting of this option for the instance
           that is being restarted.

       --force
           Specifies whether the instance is forcibly stopped immediately
           before it is restarted.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The instance is forcibly stopped immediately (default).

           false
               The subcommand waits until all threads that are associated with
               the instance are exited before stopping the instance.

       --kill
           Specifies whether the instance is killed before it is restarted by
           using functionality of the operating system to terminate the
           instance process.

           Possible values are as follows:

           false
               The instance is not killed. The subcommand uses functionality
               of the Java platform to terminate the instance process
               (default).

           true
               The instance is killed. The subcommand uses functionality of
               the operating system to terminate the instance process.

OPERANDS
       instance-name
           The name of the GlassFish Server instance to restart. If the
           instance is not running, the subcommand displays a warning message
           and attempts to start the instance.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Restarting an Instance Locally
           This example restarts the instance ymlsa1 in the domain domain1 on
           the host where the subcommand is run.

               asadmin> restart-local-instance --node localhost-domain1 ymlsa1
               Command restart-local-instance executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
