           [--create={false|true}] [--save[={false|true}]
           [--installdir as-install-parent]
           [--sshport ssh-port] [--sshuser ssh-user]

           host-list

DESCRIPTION
       The install-node subcommand installs GlassFish Server software on the
       hosts that are specified as the operand of the subcommand. This
       subcommand requires secure shell (SSH) to be configured on the host
       where the subcommand is run and on each host where the GlassFish Server
       software is being installed.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           This subcommand is           |
           |           equivalent to the            |
           |           install-node-ssh(1)          |
           |           subcommand.                  |
           +----------------------------------------+

       If necessary, the subcommand creates a ZIP archive of the GlassFish
       Server software from the installation where this subcommand is run. The
       archive does not contain the domains directory or the nodes directory.
       These directories are synchronized from the domain administration
       server (DAS) when instances on nodes that represent the hosts are
       created and started. The subcommand does not delete the archive after
       installing the GlassFish Server software from the archive on the
       specified hosts.

       If multiple hosts are specified, the configuration of the following
       items is the same on all hosts:

       *   Base installation directory

       *   SSH port

       *   SSH user

       *   SSH key file

       If the SSH key file does not exist on a host where the GlassFish Server
       software is to be installed, the subcommand runs interactively and
       prompts for a password. To enable the subcommand to run
       noninteractively, the following conditions must be met:

       *   The --interactive option of the asadmin(1M) utility must be false.

       *   The --passwordfile option of the asadmin utility must specify a
           password file.

       *   The password file must contain the AS_ADMIN_SSHPASSWORD entry.

       The subcommand does not modify the configuration of the DAS.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --archive
           The absolute path to the archive file of the GlassFish Server
           software that is to be installed. If no archive file is specified,
           the subcommand creates an archive from the installation of
           GlassFish Server software from which the subcommand is run. This
           archive is created in the home directory of the user that is
           running the command.

       --create
           Specifies whether the subcommand should create an archive file of
           the GlassFish Server software to install.

           false
               No archive file is created. The subcommand installs the
               software from the existing archive file that the --archive
               option specifies (default).

           true
               The subcommand creates an archive file from the installation of
               GlassFish Server software from which the subcommand is run.

       --save
           Specifies whether the archive file from which the software is
           installed is saved after installation.

           false
               The archive file is not saved. The subcommand deletes the file
               after installing the software (default).

           true
               The archive file is saved.

       --installdir
           The absolute path to the parent of the base installation directory
           where the GlassFish Server software is to be installed on each
           host, for example, /export/glassfish3/. If the directory does not
           exist, the subcommand creates the directory.

           The user that is running this subcommand must have write access to
           the specified directory. Otherwise, an error occurs.

           To overwrite an existing an installation of the GlassFish Server
           software, set the --force option to true. If the directory already
           contains an installation and the --force option is false, an error
           occurs.

           The default is the parent of the base installation directory of the
           GlassFish Server software on the host where this subcommand is run.

       --sshport
           The port to use for SSH connections to the host where the GlassFish
           Server software is to be installed. The default is 22.

       --sshuser
           The user on the host where the GlassFish Server software is to be
           installed that is to run the process for connecting through SSH to
           the host. The default is the user that is running this subcommand.
           To ensure that the DAS can read this user's SSH private key file,
           specify the user that is running the DAS process.

       --sshkeyfile
           The absolute path to the SSH private key file for user that the
           --sshuser option specifies. This file is used for authentication to
           the sshd daemon on the host.

           The user that is running this subcommand must be able to reach the
           path to the key file and read the key file.

           The default is a key file in the user's .ssh directory. If multiple
           key files are found, the subcommand uses the following order of
           preference:

            1. id_rsa

            2. id_dsa

            3. identity

       --force
           Specifies whether the subcommand overwrites an existing
           installation of the GlassFish Server software in the directory that
           the --installdir option specifies. Possible values are as follows:

           false
               The existing installation is not overwritten (default).

           true
               The existing installation is overwritten.

OPERANDS
       host-list
           A space-separated list of the names of the hosts where the
           GlassFish Server software is to be installed.
