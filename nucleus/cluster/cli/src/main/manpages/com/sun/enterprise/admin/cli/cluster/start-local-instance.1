start-local-instance(1)   asadmin Utility Subcommands  start-local-instance(1)

NAME
       start-local-instance - starts a GlassFish Server instance on the host
       where the subcommand is run

SYNOPSIS
           start-local-instance [--help]
           [--nodedir node-dir] [--node node]
           [--debug={false|true}] [--dry-run={true|false}]
           [--sync={normal|full|none}]
           [--verbose={false|true}] [--watchdog={true|false}]
           [instance-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The start-local-instance subcommand starts a GlassFish Server instance
       on the host where the subcommand is run. This subcommand does not
       require the secure shell (SSH) to be configured. You must run this
       command from the host where the instance resides.

       The subcommand can start any GlassFish Server instance, regardless of
       how the instance was created. For example, this subcommand can start an
       instance that was created by using the create-instance(1) subcommand.

       The start-local-instance subcommand does not contact the domain
       administration server (DAS) to determine the node on which the instance
       resides. To determine the node on which the instance resides, the
       subcommand searches the directory that contains the node directories.
       If multiple node directories exist, the node must be specified as an
       option of the subcommand.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode. However, to synchronize the
       instance with the DAS, this subcommand must be run in remote mode.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --nodedir
           Specifies the directory that contains the instance's node
           directory. The instance's files are stored in the instance's node
           directory. The default is as-install/nodes.

       --node
           Specifies the node on which the instance resides. This option may
           be omitted only if the directory that the --nodedir option
           specifies contains only one node directory. Otherwise, this option
           is required.

       --debug, -d
           Specifies whether the instance is started with Java Platform
           Debugger Architecture (JPDA)

           (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/jpda-141715.html)

           debugging enabled.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The instance is started with JPDA debugging enabled and the
               port number for JPDA debugging is displayed.

           false
               The instance is started with JPDA debugging disabled (default).

       --dry-run, -n
           Suppresses actual starting of the instance. Instead,
           start-local-instance displays the full command that would be used
           to start the instance, including all options. Reviewing this
           command can be useful when troubleshooting startup issues.

           The default value is false.

       --sync
           The type of synchronization between the DAS and the instance's
           files when the instance is started.

           Possible values are as follows:

           none
               The DAS does not synchronize the instance's files with any
               changes. This type of synchronization minimizes the time that
               is required to start the instance.

           normal
               The DAS synchronizes the instance with changes since the last
               synchronization as follows:

               *   For the config directory, the DAS synchronizes the instance
                   with all changes.

               *   For the applications directory and docroot directory, only
                   a change to a top-level subdirectory causes the DAS to
                   synchronize all files under that subdirectory.

                   If a file below a top level subdirectory is changed without
                   a change to a file in the top level subdirectory, full
                   synchronization is required. In normal operation, files
                   below the top level subdirectories of these directories are
                   not changed. If an application is deployed and undeployed,
                   full synchronization is not necessary to update the
                   instance with the change.

               This value is the default.

           full
               The DAS synchronizes the instance with all of the instance's
               files, regardless of whether the files have changed since the
               last synchronization. This type of synchronization might delay
               the startup of the instance while the DAS updates all files in
               the instance's directories.

                   Caution
                   +----------------------------------------+
                   |If the DAS is not running or is         |
                   |unreachable from the host where you are |
                   |running this subcommand, do not set the |
                   |--sync option to full. To perform a     |
                   |full synchronization, the subcommand    |
                   |removes the instance's cache. If the    |
                   |DAS cannot be contacted to replace the  |
                   |cache, the subcommand fails and the     |
                   |instance cannot be restarted until it   |
                   |is resynchronized with the DAS.         |
                   +----------------------------------------+

       --verbose, -v
           Specifies whether detailed information about the instance is
           displayed in the console window where the subcommand is run.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               Detailed startup messages and log messages about the instance
               are displayed in the console window where the subcommand is
               run. If the instance is later restarted by running the
               restart-local-instance(1) subcommand from a different console
               window, messages continue to be displayed in the original
               console window.

               You can kill the GlassFish Server process by typing CTRL-C in
               the console window.

               You can kill the GlassFish Server process and obtain a thread
               dump for the server by typing one of the following key
               combinations in the console window:

               *   CTRL-\ on UNIX systems

               *   CTRL-Break on Windows systems

           false
               Detailed information is not displayed (default).

       --watchdog, -w
           Specifies whether limited information about the instance is
           displayed in the console window where the subcommand is run. The
           --watchdog option is similar to --verbose but does not display the
           detailed startup messages and log messages. This option is useful
           when running the asadmin utility in the background or with no
           attached console.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               Limited information is displayed in the console window.

           false
               Limited information is not displayed in the console window
               (default).

OPERANDS
       instance-name
           The name of the instance to start.
