DESCRIPTION
       The create-local-instance subcommand creates a Payara Server
       instance on the node that represents the host where the subcommand is
       run. This subcommand does not require the secure shell (SSH) to be configured.

       You must run this subcommand from the host that is represented by the
       node where the instance is to reside. To contact the domain
       administration server (DAS), this subcommand requires the name of the
       host where the DAS is running. If a nondefault port is used for
       administration, this subcommand also requires the port number. If you
       are adding the first instance to a node, you must provide this
       information through the --host option and the --port option of the
       asadmin(1M) utility. For the second and later instances, this
       information is obtained from the DAS properties of the node.

       A Payara Server instance is a single Virtual Machine for the Java
       platform (Java Virtual Machine or JVM machine) on a single node in
       which Payara Server is running. A node defines the host where the
       Payara Server instance resides. The JVM machine must be compatible
       with the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE).

       A Payara Server instance requires a reference to the following
       items:

       *   The node that defines the host where the instance resides. The node
           can be specified in the command to create the instance, but is
           required only if more than one node exists in the directory where
           files for nodes are stored. If no node is specified, the behavior
           of the subcommand depends on the number of existing nodes in the
           directory where nodes are stored:

           *   If no nodes exist, the subcommand creates a node for the
               instance. The name of the node is the name of the host on which
               the subcommand is run.

           *   If only one node exists, the subcommand creates a reference to
               the existing node for the instance.

           *   If two or more nodes exist, an error occurs.

       *   The named configuration that defines the configuration of the
           instance. The configuration can be specified in the command to
           create the instance, but is not required. If no configuration is
           specified for an instance, the subcommand creates a configuration
           for the instance.

       Each Payara Server instance is one of the following types of
       instance:

       Standalone instance
           A standalone instance does not share its configuration with any
           other instances. A standalone instance is created if
           either of the following conditions is met:

           *   No configuration is specified in the command to
               create the instance.

           *   A configuration that is not referenced by any other instances
               is specified in the command to create the instance.

           When no configuration is specified, a copy of the
           default-config configuration is created for the instance. The name
           of this configuration is instance-name-config, where instance-name
           represents the name of an unclustered server instance.

       Shared instance
           A shared instance shares its configuration with other instances.
           A shared instance is created if a configuration that is
           referenced by other instances is specified in the
           command to create the instance.

       Clustered instance
           A clustered instance is an instance within a deployment group.
           A clustered instance is created if a deployment group is specified in
           the command to create the instance.

           Any instance that is not part of a deployment group is considered an
           unclustered server instance. Therefore, standalone instances and
           shared instances are unclustered server instances.

       By default, this subcommand attempts to resolve possible port conflicts
       for the instance that is being created. The subcommand also assigns
       ports that are currently not in use and not already assigned to other
       instances on the same node. The subcommand assigns these ports on the
       basis of an algorithm that is internal to the subcommand. Use the
       --systemproperties option to resolve port conflicts for additional
       instances on the same node. System properties of an instance can be
       manipulated by using the create-system-properties(1) subcommand and the
       delete-system-property(1) subcommand.

       When creating an instance, the subcommand retrieves the files that are
       required for secure synchronization with the domain administration
       server (DAS). The instance is synchronized with the DAS when the
       instance is started

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --node
           The name of the node that defines the host where the instance is to
           be created. The node must be specified only if more than one node
           exists in the directory where nodes are stored. Otherwise, the node
           may be omitted. If a node is specified, the node must exist.

           If no node is specified, the behavior of the subcommand depends on
           the number of existing nodes in the directory where nodes are
           stored:

           *   If no nodes exist, the subcommand creates a node for the
               instance. The name of the node is the name of the host on which
               the subcommand is run.

           *   If only one node exists, the subcommand creates a reference to
               the existing node for the instance.

           *   If two or more nodes exist, an error occurs.

       --nodedir
           The path to the directory in which the files for instance's node is
           to be stored. The default is as-install/nodes.

       --config
           Specifies the named configuration that the instance references. The
           configuration must exist and must not be named default-config or
           server-config. Specifying the --config option creates a shared
           instance.

           If the --config option is omitted, a standalone instance is
           created.

       --deploymentGroup
           Specifies the deployment group from which the instance inherits its
           configuration.

       --lbenabled
           Specifies whether the instance is enabled for load balancing.
           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The instance is enabled for load balancing (default).

               When an instance is enabled for load balancing, a load balancer
               sends requests to the instance.

           false
               The instance is disabled for load balancing.

               When an instance is disabled for load balancing, a load
               balancer does not send requests to the instance.

       --portbase
           Determines the number with which the port assignment should start.
           An instance uses a certain number of ports that are statically
           assigned. The portbase value determines where the assignment should
           start. The values for the ports are calculated as follows:

           *   Administration port: portbase + 48

           *   HTTP listener port: portbase + 80

           *   HTTPS listener port: portbase + 81

           *   JMS port: portbase + 76

           *   IIOP listener port: portbase + 37

           *   Secure IIOP listener port: portbase + 38

           *   Secure IIOP with mutual authentication port: portbase + 39

           *   JMX port: portbase + 86

           *   JPA debugger port: portbase + 9

           *   Felix shell service port for OSGi module management: portbase +
               66

           When the --portbase option is specified, the output of this
           subcommand includes a complete list of used ports.

       --checkports
           Specifies whether to check for the availability of the
           administration, HTTP, JMS, JMX, and IIOP ports. The default value
           is true.

       --savemasterpassword
           Setting this option to true allows the master password to be
           written to the file system. If the master password is written to
           the file system, the instance can be started without the need to
           prompt for the password. If this option is true, the
           --usemasterpassword option is also true, regardless of the value
           that is specified on the command line. Because writing the master
           password to the file system is an insecure practice, the default is
           false.

           The master-password file for an instance is saved in the node
           directory, not the domain directory. Therefore, this option is
           required only for the first instance that is created for each node
           in a domain.

       --masterpasswordlocation
           Only applies if the --savemasterpassword parameter is set to true.
           This parameter receives an absolute filepath that the master password
           will be saved to.

       --usemasterpassword
           Specifies whether the key store is encrypted with a master password
           that is built into the system or a user-defined master password.

           If false (default), the keystore is encrypted with a well-known
           password that is built into the system. Encrypting the keystore
           with a password that is built into the system provides no
           additional security.

           If true, the subcommand obtains the master password from the
           AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD entry in the password file or prompts for
           the master password. The password file is specified in the
           --passwordfile option of the asadmin(1M)utility.

           If the --savemasterpassword option is true, this option is also
           true, regardless of the value that is specified on the command
           line.

           The master password must be the same for all instances in a domain.

       --systemproperties
           Defines system properties for the instance. These properties
           override property definitions for port settings in the instance's
           configuration. Predefined port settings must be overridden if, for
           example, two instances reside on the same host. In this
           situation, port settings for one instance must be overridden
           because both instances share the same configuration.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating a Standalone Payara Server Instance
           This example creates the standalone instance il3 on the host where
           the command is run. The DAS is running on the same host. The
           instance references the only existing node.

               asadmin> create-local-instance il3
               Rendezvoused with DAS on localhost:4848.

       Example 2, Creating a Clustered Payara Server Instance on a Specific
       Node
           This example creates the instance ymli2 on node sj02. The
           instance is a member of the deployment group ymlgroup.

           The command is run on the host sj02, which is the host that the
           node sj02 represents. The DAS is running on the host sr04 and uses
           the default HTTP port for administration. Because no instances
           exist on the node, the host on which the DAS is running is provided
           through the --host option of the asadmin utility.

               sj02# asadmin --host sr04 create-local-instance --deploymentGroup ymlgroup --node sj02 ymli2
               Rendezvoused with DAS on sr04:4848.
