NAME
       validate-multicast - validates that multicast transport is available
       for clusters

SYNOPSIS
           validate-multicast [--help] [--multicastport multicastport]
           [--multicastaddress multicastaddress]
           [--bindaddress bindaddress]
           [--sendperiod sendperiod]
           [--timeout timeout]
           [--timetolive timetolive]
           [--verbose={false|true}]

DESCRIPTION
       The validate-multicast subcommand validates that multicast transport is
       available for clusters. You should run this subcommand at the same time
       on each of the hosts to be validated. This subcommand is available in
       local mode.

           Note

           |           Do not run the               |
           |           validate-multicast           |
           |           subcommand using the DAS and |
           |           cluster's multicast address  |
           |           and port values while the    |
           |           DAS and cluster are running. |
           |           Doing so results in an       |
           |           error.                       |
           |           The validate-multicast       |
           |           subcommand must be run at    |
           |           the same time on two or more |
           |           machines to validate whether |
           |           multicast messages are being |
           |           received between the         |
           |           machines.                    |
           +----------------------------------------+

       As long as all machines see each other, multicast is validated to be
       working properly across the machines. If the machines are not seeing
       each other, set the --bindaddress option explicitly to ensure that all
       machines are using interface on same subnet, or increase the
       --timetolive option from the default of 4. If these changes fail to
       resolve the multicast issues, ask the network administrator to verify
       that the network is configured so the multicast messages can be seen
       between all the machines used to run the cluster.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --multicastport
           The port for the multicast socket on which the Group Management
           Service (GMS) listens for group events. Specify a standard UDP port
           number in the range 2048-32000. The default is 2048.

       --multicastaddress
           The address for the multicast socket on which the GMS listens for
           group events. Specify a class D IP address. Class D IP addresses
           are in the range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255, inclusive. The
           address 224.0.0.0 is reserved and should not be used. The default
           is 228.9.3.1.

       --bindaddress
           The local interface to receive multicast datagram packets for the
           GMS. The default is to use all available binding interfaces.

           On a multi-home machine (possessing two or more network
           interfaces), this attribute enables you to indicate which network
           interface is used for the GMS. This value must be a local network
           interface IP address.

       --sendperiod
           The number of milliseconds between test messages sent between
           nodes. The default is 2000.

       --timeout
           The number of seconds before the subcommand times out and exits.
           The default is 20. You can also exit this subcommand using Ctrl-C.

       --timetolive
           The default time-to-live for multicast packets sent out on the
           multicast socket in order to control the scope of the multicasts.
           The time-to-live value must be between zero and 255 inclusive. The
           default is the JDK default or a minimum defined by a constant in
           the GMS subsystem, whichever is lower. To see the time-to-live
           value being used, use the --verbose option.

       --verbose
           If used without a value or set to true, provides additional
           debugging information. The default is false.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Validating multicast transport
           Run from host machine1:

               asadmin> validate-multicast
               Will use port 2,048
               Will use address 228.9.3.1
               Will use bind address null
               Will use wait period 2,000 (in milliseconds)

               Listening for data...
               Sending message with content "machine1" every 2,000 milliseconds
               Received data from machine1 (loopback)
               Received data from machine2
               Exiting after 20 seconds. To change this timeout, use the --timeout command line option.
               Command validate-multicast executed successfully
           Run from host machine2:

               asadmin> validate-multicast
               Will use port 2,048
               Will use address 228.9.3.1
               Will use bind address null
               Will use wait period 2,000 (in milliseconds)

               Listening for data...
               Sending message with content "machine2" every 2,000 milliseconds
               Received data from machine2 (loopback)
               Received data from machine1
               Exiting after 20 seconds. To change this timeout, use the --timeout command line option.
               Command validate-multicast executed successfully

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
