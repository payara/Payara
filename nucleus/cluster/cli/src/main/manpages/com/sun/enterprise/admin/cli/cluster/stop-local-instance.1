stop-local-instance(1)    asadmin Utility Subcommands   stop-local-instance(1)

NAME
       stop-local-instance - stops a GlassFish Server instance on the machine
       where the subcommand is run

SYNOPSIS
           stop-local-instance [--help]
           [--nodedir node-dir] [--node node]
           [--force={true|false}] [--kill={false|true}]
           [instance-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The stop-local-instance subcommand stops a GlassFish Server instance on
       the machine where the subcommand is run. This subcommand does not
       require secure shell (SSH) to be configured. You must run this command
       from the machine where the instance resides.

       The subcommand can stop any GlassFish Server instance, regardless of
       how the instance was created. For example, this subcommand can stop an
       instance that was created by using the create-instance(1) subcommand.

       The stop-local-instance subcommand does not contact the DAS to
       determine the node on which the instance resides. To determine the node
       on which the instance resides, the subcommand searches the directory
       that contains the node directories. If multiple node directories exist,
       the node must be specified as an option of the subcommand.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --nodedir
           Specifies the directory that contains the instance's node
           directory. The instance's files are stored in the instance's node
           directory. The default is as-install/nodes.

       --node
           Specifies the node on which the instance resides. This option may
           be omitted only if the directory that the --nodedir option
           specifies contains only one node directory. Otherwise, this option
           is required.

       --force
           Specifies whether the instance is forcibly stopped immediately.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The instance is forcibly stopped immediately (default).

           false
               The subcommand waits until all threads that are associated with
               the instance are exited before stopping the instance.

       --kill
           Specifies whether the instance is killed by using functionality of
           the operating system to terminate the instance process.

           Possible values are as follows:

           false
               The instance is not killed. The subcommand uses functionality
               of the Java platform to terminate the instance process
               (default).

           true
               The instance is killed. The subcommand uses functionality of
               the operating system to terminate the instance process.

OPERANDS
       instance-name
           The name of the instance to stop.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Stopping an Instance Locally
           This example stops the instance yml-i-sj01 on the machine where the
           subcommand is run.

               asadmin> stop-local-instance --node sj01 yml-i-sj01
               Waiting for the instance to stop ...

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
