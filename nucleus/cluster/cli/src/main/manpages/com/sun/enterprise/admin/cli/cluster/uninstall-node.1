uninstall-node(1)         asadmin Utility Subcommands        uninstall-node(1)

NAME
       uninstall-node - uninstalls GlassFish Server software from specified
       hosts

SYNOPSIS
           uninstall-node [--help]
           [--installdir as-install-parent]
           [--sshport ssh-port] [--sshuser ssh-user]
           [--sshkeyfile ssh-keyfile]
           [--force={false|true}]
           host-list

DESCRIPTION
       The uninstall-node subcommand uninstalls GlassFish Server software from
       the hosts that are specified as the operand of the subcommand. This
       subcommand requires secure shell (SSH) to be configured on the host
       where the subcommand is run and on each host where the GlassFish Server
       software is being uninstalled.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           This subcommand is           |
           |           equivalent to the            |
           |           uninstall-node-ssh(1)        |
           |           subcommand.                  |
           +----------------------------------------+

       By default, if any node except the predefined node localhost-domain
       resides on any host from which GlassFish Server software is being
       uninstalled, the subcommand fails. To uninstall the GlassFish Server
       software from a host on which user-defined nodes reside, set the
       --force option to true. If the --force option is true, the subcommand
       removes the entire content of the parent of the base installation
       directory.

       If a file under the parent of the base installation directory is open,
       the subcommand fails.

       If multiple hosts are specified, the configuration of the following
       items must be the same on all hosts:

       *   Parent of the base installation directory for the GlassFish Server
           software

       *   SSH port

       *   SSH user

       *   SSH key file

       The subcommand does not modify the configuration of the domain
       administration server (DAS).

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --installdir
           The absolute path to the parent of the base installation directory
           where the GlassFish Server software is installed on each host, for
           example, /export/glassfish3/.

           The user that is running this subcommand must have write access to
           the specified directory. Otherwise, an error occurs.

           The specified directory must contain the installation of the
           GlassFish Server software on the host. Otherwise, an error occurs.

           The default is the parent of the base installation directory of the
           GlassFish Server software on the host where this subcommand is run.

       --sshport
           The port to use for SSH connections to the host where the GlassFish
           Server software is to be uninstalled. The default is 22.

       --sshuser
           The user on the host where the GlassFish Server software is to be
           uninstalled that is to run the process for connecting through SSH
           to the host. The default is the user that is running this
           subcommand. To ensure that the DAS can read this user's SSH private
           key file, specify the user that is running the DAS process.

       --sshkeyfile
           The absolute path to the SSH private key file for user that the
           --sshuser option specifies. This file is used for authentication to
           the sshd daemon on the host.

           The user that is running this subcommand must be able to reach the
           path to the key file and read the key file.

           The default is a key file in the user's .ssh directory. If multiple
           key files are found, the subcommand uses the following order of
           preference:

            1. id_rsa

            2. id_dsa

            3. identity

       --force
           Specifies whether the subcommand uninstalls the GlassFish Server
           software from a host even if a user-defined node resides on the
           host. Possible values are as follows:

           false
               If a user-defined node resides on a host, the software is not
               uninstalled and the subcommand fails (default).

               If the --force option is false, the subcommand removes only the
               GlassFish Server software files. Other content if the parent of
               the base installation directory, such as configuration files,
               are not removed.

           true
               The subcommand uninstalls the GlassFish Server software from
               the host even if a user-defined node resides on the host.

               If the --force option is true, the subcommand removes the
               entire content of the parent of the base installation
               directory.

OPERANDS
       host-list
           A space-separated list of the names of the hosts from which the
           GlassFish Server software is to be uninstalled.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Uninstalling GlassFish Server Software From the Default
       Location
           This example uninstalls GlassFish Server software on the hosts
           sj03.example.com and sj04.example.com from the default location.

               asadmin> uninstall-node sj03 sj04
               Successfully connected to gfuser@sj03.example.com using keyfile /home/gfuser
               /.ssh/id_rsa
               Successfully connected to gfuser@sj04.example.com using keyfile /home/gfuser
               /.ssh/id_rsa
               Command uninstall-node executed successfully.

       Example 2, Forcibly Uninstalling GlassFish Server Software
           This example uninstalls GlassFish Server software on the host
           sj02.example.com.

           The software is uninstalled even if a user-defined node resides on
           the host. The entire content of the /export/glassfish3 directory is
           removed.

           Some lines of output are omitted from this example for readability.

               asadmin> uninstall-node --force --installdir /export/glassfish3 sj02.example.com
               Successfully connected to gfuser@sj02.example.com using keyfile /home/gfuser
               /.ssh/id_rsa
               Force removing file /export/glassfish3/mq/lib/help/en/add_overrides.htm
               Force removing file /export/glassfish3/mq/lib/help/en/add_connfact.htm
               ...
               Force removing directory /export/glassfish3/glassfish/lib/appclient
               Force removing directory /export/glassfish3/glassfish/lib
               Force removing directory /export/glassfish3/glassfish
