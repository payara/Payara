NAME
       import-sync-bundle - imports the configuration data of an
       instance from an archive file

SYNOPSIS
           import-sync-bundle [--help]
           --instance instance-name
           [--nodedir node-dir] [--node node-name]
           file-name

DESCRIPTION
       The import-sync-bundle subcommand imports the configuration data of an
       instance from an archive file that was
       created by the export-sync-bundle(1) subcommand.

       You must run this subcommand on the host where the instance resides. To
       contact the domain administration server (DAS), this subcommand
       requires the name of the host where the DAS is running. If a nondefault
       port is used for administration, this subcommand also requires the port
       number. You must provide this information through the --host option and
       the --port option of the asadmin(1M) utility.

       Importing an instance's configuration data transfers the data to a host
       for an instance without the need for the instance to be able to
       communicate with the DAS. Importing an instance's configuration data is
       typically required for the following reasons:

       *   To reestablish the instance after an upgrade

       *   To synchronize the instance manually with the domain administration
           server (DAS) when the instance cannot contact the DAS

       The subcommand imports an instance's configuration data by performing
       the following operations:

       *   Creating or updating the instance's files and directories

       *   Attempting to register the instance with the DAS

       If the attempt to register the instance with the DAS fails, the
       subcommand does not fail. Instead, the subcommand displays a warning
       that the attempt failed. The warning contains the command to run to
       register the instance with the DAS.

       The import-sync-bundle subcommand does not contact the DAS to determine
       the node on which the instance resides. If the node is not specified as
       an option of the subcommand, the subcommand determines the node from
       the DAS configuration in the archive file.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --instance
           The instance for which configuration data is being imported. The
           instance must already exist in the DAS configuration. The archive
           file from which the data is being imported must contain data for
           the specified instance.

       --nodedir
           The directory that contains the instance's node directory. The
           instance's files are stored in the instance's node directory. The
           default is as-install/nodes.

       --node
           The node on which the instance resides. If this option is omitted,
           the subcommand determines the node from the DAS configuration in
           the archive file.

OPERANDS
       file-name
           The name of the file, including the path, that contains the archive
           file to import. This operand is required.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Importing Configuration Data for an Instance
           This example imports the configuration for the instance
           ymli2 on the node sj02 from the archive file
           /export/glassfish3/glassfish/domains/domain1/sync/ymlcluster-sync-bundle.zip.

           The command is run on the host sj02, which is the host that the
           node sj02 represents. The DAS is running on the host sr04 and uses
           the default HTTP port for administration.

               sj02# asadmin --host sr04 import-sync-bundle --node sj02 --instance ymli2
               /export/glassfish3/glassfish/domains/domain1/sync/ymlcluster-sync-bundle.zip
               Command import-sync-bundle executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
