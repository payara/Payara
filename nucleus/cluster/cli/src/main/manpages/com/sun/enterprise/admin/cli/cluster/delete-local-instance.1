delete-local-instance(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands delete-local-instance(1)

NAME
       delete-local-instance - deletes a GlassFish Server instance on the
       machine where the subcommand is run

SYNOPSIS
           delete-local-instance [--help]
           [--nodedir node-dir] [--node node-name]
           [instance-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-local-instance subcommand deletes a GlassFish Server
       instance on the machine where the subcommand is run. This subcommand
       does not require the secure shell (SSH) to be configured. You must
       run this command from the machine where the instance resides.

       The subcommand can delete any GlassFish Server instance, regardless of
       how the instance was created. For example, this subcommand can delete
       an instance that was created by using the create-instance(1)
       subcommand.

       The instance that is being deleted must not be running. Otherwise, an
       error occurs.

       The subcommand deletes an instance by performing the following actions:

       *   Removing the instance from the configuration of the domain
           administration server (DAS)

       *   Deleting the instance's files from file system

       If the instance that is being deleted is the only instance that is
       using the node directory, that directory is also removed.

       If a standalone instance is deleted, the instance's standalone
       configuration is also deleted. A standalone instance refers to a
       configuration that is named instance-name-config to which no other
       clusters or unclustered instances refer.

       The delete-local-instance subcommand does not contact the DAS to
       determine the node on which the instance resides. To determine the node
       on which the instance resides, the subcommand searches the directory
       that contains the node directories. If multiple node directories exist,
       the node must be specified as an option of the subcommand.

       If no operand is specified and only one instance resides on the
       specified node, the subcommand deletes the instance. If no operand is
       specified and multiple instances reside on the node, an error occurs.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --nodedir
           Specifies the directory that contains the instance's node
           directory. The instance's files are stored in the instance's node
           directory. The default is as-install/nodes.

       --node
           Specifies the node on which the instance resides. This option may
           be omitted only if the directory that the --nodedir option
           specifies contains only one node directory. Otherwise, this option
           is required.

OPERANDS
       instance-name
           The name of the instance to delete. This operand may be omitted if
           only one instance resides on the specified node. Otherwise, this
           operand is required.
