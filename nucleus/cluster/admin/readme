DOCS -- 
1. added a new arg to uninstall-node command == --type



Here is a command to create a remote ssh node --

asadmin --passwordfile ~/chandu_pw create-node-ssh --install --nodehost chandu.us.oracle.com --installdir /export/home/hudson/devtest-bnlocal/foo  --sshuser hudson ssh_node1 


And here is the resulting config in domain.xml

<nodes>
	<node node-host="localhost" name="localhost-domain1" type="CONFIG" install-dir="${com.sun.aas.productRoot}"></node>

	<node node-host="chandu.us.oracle.com" name="ssh_node1" type="SSH" install-dir="/export/home/hudson/devtest-bnlocal/foo">
		<ssh-connector>
			<ssh-auth user-name="hudson" password="actual-password-would-be-here-removed-from-readme!"></ssh-auth>
		</ssh-connector>
	</node>

    <node node-host="wnevins-lnr" name="xyz" type="DCOM" install-dir="${com.sun.aas.productRoot}">
      <ssh-connector ssh-port="135">
        <ssh-auth user-name="wnevins" password="password-here!!"></ssh-auth>
      </ssh-connector>
    </node>
