create-node-config(1)     asadmin Utility Subcommands    create-node-config(1)

NAME
       create-node-config - creates a node that is not enabled for remote
       communication

SYNOPSIS
           create-node-config [--help]
           [--nodehost node-host]
           [--installdir as-install-parent] [--nodedir node-dir] node-name

DESCRIPTION
       The create-node-config subcommand creates a node that is not enabled
       for remote communication. The create-node-config subcommand does not
       require the secure shell (SSH) to be configured to create the node.

       A node represents a host on which the GlassFish Server software is
       installed. A node must exist for every host on which GlassFish Server
       instances reside.

           Note
           +---------------------------------------+
           |           To represent the host where |
           |           the DAS is running,         |
           |           GlassFish Server provides   |
           |           the predefined node         |
           |           localhost-domain. The       |
           |           predefined node             |
           |           localhost-domain is not     |
           |           enabled for remote          |
           |           communication.              |
           +---------------------------------------+

       All administration of instances on a node that is not enabled for
       remote communication must be performed on the host that the node
       represents. The domain administration server (DAS) on a remote host
       cannot contact the node. To administer instances on a node that
       represents a host that is remote from the DAS, you must use the
       following subcommands:

       *   create-local-instance(1)

       *   delete-local-instance(1)

       *   start-local-instance(1)

       However, you may use stop-local-instance(1) or stop-instance(1) to stop
       the instances.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --nodehost
           The name of the host that the node represents. If this option is
           omitted, no host is specified for the node.

       --installdir
           The full path to the parent of the base installation directory of
           the GlassFish Server software on the host, for example,
           /export/glassfish3/. If this option is omitted, no parent of the
           base installation directory of the GlassFish Server software is
           specified for the node.

       --nodedir
           The path to the directory that is to contain GlassFish Server
           instances that are created on the node. If a relative path is
           specified, the path is relative to the as-install directory. If
           this option is omitted, no directory for instances is specified for
           the node.

OPERANDS
       node-name
           The name of the node.

           The name must meet the following requirements:

           *   The name may contain only ASCII characters.

           *   The name must start with a letter, a number, or an underscore.

           *   The name may contain only the following characters:

               *   Lowercase letters

               *   Uppercase letters

               *   Numbers

               *   Hyphen

               *   Period

               *   Underscore

           *   The name must be unique in the domain and must not be the name
               of another node, a cluster, a named configuration, or a
               GlassFish Server instance.

           *   The name must not be domain, server, or any other keyword that
               is reserved by GlassFish Server.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating a Node That Is Not Enabled for Remote Communication
           This example creates the node sj03 for host sj03.example.com. The
           node is not enabled for remote communication.

               asadmin> create-node-config --nodehost sj03.example.com sj03

               Command create-node-config executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
