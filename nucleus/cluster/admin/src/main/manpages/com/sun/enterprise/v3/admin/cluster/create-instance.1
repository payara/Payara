DESCRIPTION
       The create-instance subcommand creates a GlassFish Server instance.
       This subcommand requires the secure shell (SSH) to be configured on the host
       where the domain administration server (DAS) is running and on the host
       that is represented by the node where the instance is to reside.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           SSH is not required          |
           |           if the instance is to reside |
           |           on a node of type CONFIG     |
           |           that represents the local    |
           |           host. A node of type CONFIG  |
           |           is not enabled for remote    |
           |           communication over SSH.      |
           +----------------------------------------+

       You may run this command from any host that can contact the DAS.

       A GlassFish Server instance is a single Virtual Machine for the Java
       platform (Java Virtual Machine or JVM machine) on a single node in
       which GlassFish Server is running. A node defines the host where the
       GlassFish Server instance resides. The JVM machine must be compatible
       with the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE).

       A GlassFish Server instance requires a reference to the following
       items:

       *   The node that defines the host where the instance resides. The node
           must be specified in the command to create the instance.

       *   The named configuration that defines the configuration of the
           instance. The configuration can be specified in the command to
           create the instance, but is not required. If no configuration is
           specified for an instance that is not joining a cluster, the
           subcommand creates a configuration for the instance. An instance
           that is joining a cluster receives its configuration from its
           parent cluster.

       Each GlassFish Server instance is one of the following types of
       instance:

       Standalone instance
           A standalone instance does not share its configuration with any
           other instances or clusters. A standalone instance is created if
           either of the following conditions is met:

           *   No configuration or cluster is specified in the command to
               create the instance.

           *   A configuration that is not referenced by any other instances
               or clusters is specified in the command to create the instance.

           When no configuration or cluster is specified, a copy of the
           default-config configuration is created for the instance. The name
           of this configuration is instance-name-config, where instance-name
           represents the name of an unclustered server instance.

       Shared instance
           A shared instance shares its configuration with other instances or
           clusters. A shared instance is created if a configuration that is
           referenced by other instances or clusters is specified in the
           command to create the instance.

       Clustered instance
           A clustered instance inherits its configuration from the cluster to
           which the instance belongs and shares its configuration with other
           instances in the cluster. A clustered instance is created if a
           cluster is specified in the command to create the instance.

           Any instance that is not part of a cluster is considered an
           unclustered server instance. Therefore, standalone instances and
           shared instances are unclustered server instances.

       By default, this subcommand attempts to resolve possible port conflicts
       for the instance that is being created. The subcommand also assigns
       ports that are currently not in use and not already assigned to other
       instances on the same node. The subcommand assigns these ports on the
       basis of an algorithm that is internal to the subcommand. Use the
       --systemproperties option to resolve port conflicts for additional
       instances on the same node. System properties of an instance can be
       manipulated by using the create-system-properties(1) subcommand and the
       delete-system-property(1) subcommand.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --node
           The name of the node that defines the host where the instance is to
           be created. The node must already exist. If the instance is to be
           created on the host where the domain administration server (DAS) is
           running, use the predefined node localhost-domain.

       --config
           Specifies the named configuration that the instance references. The
           configuration must exist and must not be named default-config or
           server-config. Specifying the --config option creates a shared
           instance.

           The --config option and the --cluster option are mutually
           exclusive. If both options are omitted, a standalone instance is
           created.

       --cluster
           Specifies the cluster from which the instance inherits its
           configuration. Specifying the --cluster option creates a clustered
           instance.

           The --config option and the --cluster option are mutually
           exclusive. If both options are omitted, a standalone instance is
           created.

       --lbenabled
           Specifies whether the instance is enabled for load balancing.
           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The instance is enabled for load balancing (default).

               When an instance is enabled for load balancing, a load balancer
               sends requests to the instance.

           false
               The instance is disabled for load balancing.

               When an instance is disabled for load balancing, a load
               balancer does not send requests to the instance.

       --portbase
           Determines the number with which the port assignment should start.
           An instance uses a certain number of ports that are statically
           assigned. The portbase value determines where the assignment should
           start. The values for the ports are calculated as follows:

           *   Administration port: portbase + 48

           *   HTTP listener port: portbase + 80

           *   HTTPS listener port: portbase + 81

           *   JMS port: portbase + 76

           *   IIOP listener port: portbase + 37

           *   Secure IIOP listener port: portbase + 38

           *   Secure IIOP with mutual authentication port: portbase + 39

           *   JMX port: portbase + 86

           *   JPA debugger port: portbase + 9

           *   Felix shell service port for OSGi module management: portbase +
               66

           When the --portbase option is specified, the output of this
           subcommand includes a complete list of used ports.

       --checkports
           Specifies whether to check for the availability of the
           administration, HTTP, JMS, JMX, and IIOP ports. The default value
           is true.

       --systemproperties
           Defines system properties for the instance. These properties
           override property definitions for port settings in the instance's
           configuration. Predefined port settings must be overridden if, for
           example, two clustered instances reside on the same host. In this
           situation, port settings for one instance must be overridden
           because both instances share the same configuration.
