update-node-config(1)     asadmin Utility Subcommands    update-node-config(1)

NAME
       update-node-config - updates the configuration data of a node

SYNOPSIS
           update-node-config [--help]
           [--nodehost node-host]
           [--installdir as-install-parent] [--nodedir node-dir]
           node-name

DESCRIPTION
       The update-node-config subcommand updates the configuration data of a
       node.

       This subcommand can update any node, regardless of whether the node is
       enabled for remote communication. If a node that is enabled for remote
       communication is updated, the node is not enabled for remote
       communication after the update.

       Options of this subcommand specify the new values of the node's
       configuration data. The default for these options is to leave the
       existing value unchanged.

       This subcommand does not require the secure shell (SSH) to be configured
       to update the node. You may run this subcommand from any host that can contact
       the DAS.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --nodehost
           The name of the host that the node is to represent after the node
           is updated.

       --installdir
           The full path to the parent of the base installation directory of
           the GlassFish Server software on the host, for example,
           /export/glassfish3.

       --nodedir
           The path to the directory that is to contain GlassFish Server
           instances that are created on the node. If a relative path is
           specified, the path is relative to the as-install directory, where
           as-install is the base installation directory of the GlassFish
           Server software on the host.

OPERANDS
       node-name
           The name of the node to update. The node must exist. Otherwise, an
           error occurs.
