start-cluster(1)          asadmin Utility Subcommands         start-cluster(1)

NAME
       start-cluster - starts a cluster

SYNOPSIS
           start-cluster [--help]
           [--verbose={false|true}] [--timeout timeout]
           [--instancetimeout timeout] cluster-name

DESCRIPTION
       The start-cluster subcommand starts a cluster by starting all GlassFish
       Server instances in the cluster that are not already running. This
       subcommand requires the secure shell (SSH) to be configured on the host
       where the domain administration server (DAS) is running and on all
       hosts where instances in the cluster reside.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           If all instances reside on   |
           |           the same host as the DAS,    |
           |           SSH is not required. You     |
           |           might require to start a     |
           |           cluster in which instances   |
           |           reside on hosts where        |
           |           SSH is not configured        |
           |           that are remote from the     |
           |           DAS. In this situation, run  |
           |           the start-local-instance(1)  |
           |           subcommand for each instance |
           |           from the host where the      |
           |           instance resides.            |
           +----------------------------------------+

       You may run this subcommand from any host that can contact the DAS.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

       --verbose

           Valid values are as follows:

           true
               Displays the command to start each instance in the cluster and
               whether the attempt to start each instance succeeded.

           false
               Displays no additional status information (default).

       --timeout
           Specifies the amount of time in seconds the command will run for before timing
           out.

       --instancetimeout
           Specifies the amount of time in seconds each instance will attempt to start
           before timing out.

       cluster-name
           The name of the cluster to start.
