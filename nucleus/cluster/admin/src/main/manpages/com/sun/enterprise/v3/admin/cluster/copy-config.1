copy-config(1)            asadmin Utility Subcommands           copy-config(1)

NAME
       copy-config - copies an existing named configuration to create another
       configuration

SYNOPSIS
           copy-config [--help]
           [--systemproperties (name=value)[:name=value]*]
           source-configuration-name destination-configuration-name

DESCRIPTION
       The copy-config subcommand creates a named configuration in the
       configuration of the domain administration server (DAS) by copying an
       existing configuration. The new configuration is identical to the
       copied configuration, except for any properties that you specify in the
       --systemproperties option.

       The default-config configuration is copied when a standalone sever
       instance or standalone cluster is created.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --systemproperties
           Optional attribute name-value pairs for the configuration. These
           properties override port settings in the configuration.

           The following properties are available:

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Copying a Configuration

           following ports:

           *   HTTP listener port

           *   HTTPS listener port

               asadmin> copy-config
               --systemproperties HTTP_LISTENER_PORT=2000:HTTP_SSL_LISTENER_PORT=3000
