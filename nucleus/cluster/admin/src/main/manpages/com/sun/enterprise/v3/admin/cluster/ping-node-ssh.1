ping-node-ssh(1)          asadmin Utility Subcommands         ping-node-ssh(1)

NAME
       ping-node-ssh - tests if a node that is enabled for communication over
       SSH is usable

SYNOPSIS
           ping-node-ssh [--help]
           [--validate={false|true}] node-name

DESCRIPTION
       The ping-node-ssh subcommand tests if a node that is enabled for
       communication over secure shell (SSH) is usable. This subcommand
       requires secure shell (SSH) to be configured on the machine where the
       domain administration server (DAS) is running and on the machine where
       the node resides. You may run this command from any machine that can
       contact the DAS.

       If the node is usable, the subcommand displays a confirmation that the
       subcommand could connect to the node through SSH. This confirmation
       includes the name of the host that the node represents.

       Optionally, the subcommand can also validate the node to determine if
       the asadmin(1M) utility can run on the host that the node represents.
       To validate a node, the subcommand runs the version(1) subcommand. If
       the node is valid, the subcommand displays the version that the version
       subcommand returns.

       The node that is specified as the operand of this subcommand must be
       enabled for communication over SSH. If the node is not enabled for
       communication over SSH, an error occurs. To determine whether a node is
       enabled for communication over SSH, use the list-nodes(1) subcommand.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --validate
           Specifies whether the subcommand validates the node.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The node is validated.

           false
               The node is not validated (default).

OPERANDS
       node-name
           The name of the node to test. The node must be enabled for
           communication over SSH. Otherwise, an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Testing if an SSH-Enabled Node Is Usable
           This example tests if the SSH-enabled node sj03-node is usable.

               asadmin> ping-node-ssh sj03-node
               Successfully made SSH connection to node sj03-node (sj03.example.com)
               Command ping-node-ssh executed successfully.

       Example 2, Validating an SSH-Enabled Node
           This example validates the SSH-enabled node adc-node.

               asadmin> ping-node-ssh --validate=true adc-node
               Successfully made SSH connection to node adcnode (adc.example.com)
