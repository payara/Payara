NAME
       restart-instance - restarts a running GlassFish Server instance

SYNOPSIS
           restart-instance [--help]
           [--debug={false|true}] instance-name

DESCRIPTION
       The restart-instance subcommand restarts a running GlassFish Server
       instance. This subcommand requires secure shell (SSH) to be configured
       on the machine where the domain administration server (DAS) is running
       and on the machine where the instance resides.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           SSH is not required if the   |
           |           instance resides on a node   |
           |           of type CONFIG that          |
           |           represents the local host. A |
           |           node of type CONFIG is not   |
           |           enabled for communication    |
           |           over SSH.                    |
           +----------------------------------------+

       You may run this subcommand from any machine that can contact the DAS.

       The subcommand can restart any GlassFish Server instance, regardless of
       how the instance was created. For example, this subcommand can restart
       an instance that was created by using the create-local-instance(1)
       subcommand.

       When this subcommand restarts an instance, the DAS synchronizes the
       instance with changes since the last synchronization as follows:

       *   For the config directory, the DAS synchronizes the instance with
           all changes.

       *   For the applications directory and docroot directory, only a change
           to a top-level subdirectory causes the DAS to synchronize all files
           under that subdirectory.

           If a file below a top level subdirectory is changed without a
           change to a file in the top level subdirectory, full
           synchronization is required. In normal operation, files below the
           top level subdirectories of these directories are not changed. If
           an application is deployed and undeployed, full synchronization is
           not necessary to update the instance with the change.

       If different synchronization behavior is required, the instance must be
       stopped and restarted by using following sequence of subcommands:

        1. stop-instance(1)

        2. start-instance(1)

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --debug
           Specifies whether the instance is restarted with Java Platform
           Debugger Architecture (JPDA)

           (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/jpda-141715.html)

           debugging enabled.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The instance is restarted with JPDA debugging enabled and the
               port number for JPDA debugging is displayed.

           false
               The instance is restarted with JPDA debugging disabled.

           The default is the current setting of this option for the instance
           that is being restarted.

OPERANDS
       instance-name
           The name of the GlassFish Server instance to restart. If the
           instance is not running, the subcommand displays a warning message
           and attempts to start the instance.

EXAMPLES
