DESCRIPTION
       The update-node-ssh subcommand updates the configuration data of a
       node. This subcommand requires secure shell (SSH) to be configured on
       the machine where the domain administration server (DAS) is running and
       on the machine where the node resides. You may run this subcommand from
       any machine that can contact the DAS.

       This subcommand can update any node, regardless of whether the node is
       enabled for remote communication. If the node is not enabled for remote
       communication, the subcommand enables SSH communication for the node
       and updates any other specified configuration data.

       Options of this subcommand specify the new values of the node's
       configuration data. The default for most options is to leave the
       existing value unchanged. However, if this subcommand is run to enable
       SSH communication for a node, default values are applied if any of the
       following options is omitted:

       *   --sshport

       *   --sshuser

       *   --sshkeyfile

       By default, the subcommand fails and the node is not updated if the DAS
       cannot contact the node's host through SSH. To force the node to be
       updated even if the host cannot be contacted through SSH, set the
       --force option to true.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --nodehost
           The name of the host that the node is to represent after the node
           is updated.

       --installdir
           The full path to the parent of the base installation directory of
           the GlassFish Server software on the host, for example,
           /export/glassfish3.

       --nodedir
           The path to the directory that is to contain GlassFish Server
           instances that are created on the node. If a relative path is
           specified, the path is relative to the as-install directory, where
           as-install is the base installation directory of the GlassFish
           Server software on the host.

       --sshport
           The port to use for SSH connections to this node's host. The
           default depends on whether this subcommand is run to enable SSH
           communication for the node:

           *   If the node is already enabled for communication over SSH, the
               default is to leave the port unchanged.

           *   If this subcommand is run to enable SSH communication for the
               node, the default port is 22.

           If the --nodehost is set to localhost, the --sshport option is
           ignored.

       --sshuser
           The user on this node's host that is to run the process for
           connecting to the host through SSH. The default depends on whether
           this subcommand is run to enable SSH communication for the node:

           *   If the node is already enabled for communication over SSH, the
               default is to leave the user unchanged.

           *   If this subcommand is run to enable SSH communication for the
               node, the default is the user that is running the DAS process.

           If the --nodehost option is set to localhost, the --sshuser option
           is ignored.

       --sshkeyfile
           The absolute path to the SSH private key file for user that the
           --sshuser option specifies. This file is used for authentication to
           the sshd daemon on the node's host.

               Note
               +----------------------------------------+
               |GlassFish Server also supports password |
               |authentication through the              |
               |AS_ADMIN_SSHPASSWORD entry in the       |
               |password file. The password file is     |
               |specified in the --paswordfile option   |
               |of the asadmin(1M) utility.             |
               +----------------------------------------+
           If the SSH private key file is protected by a passphrase, the
           password file must contain the AS_ADMIN_SSHKEYPASSPHRASE entry.

           The path to the key file must be reachable by the DAS and the key
           file must be readable by the DAS.

           The default depends on whether this subcommand is run to enable SSH
           communication for the node:

           *   If the node is already enabled for communication over SSH, the
               default is to leave the key file unchanged.

           *   If this subcommand is run to enable SSH communication for the
               node, the default is the key file in the user's .ssh directory.
               If multiple key files are found, the subcommand uses the
               following order of preference:

                1. id_rsa

                2. id_dsa

                3. identity

       --force
           Specifies whether the node is updated even if validation of the
           node's parameters fails. To validate a node's parameters, the DAS
           must be able to contact the node's host through SSH. Possible
           values are as follows:

           false
               The node is not updated if validation of the node's parameters
               fails (default).

           true
               The node is updated even if validation of the node's parameters
               fails.

OPERANDS
       node-name
           The name of the node to update. The node must exist. Otherwise, an
           error occurs.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Updating the Host That a Node Represents
           This example updates the host that the node lssh represents to
           sj04.

               asadmin> update-node-ssh --nodehost sj04 lssh
               Command update-node-ssh executed successfully.

       Example 2, Forcing the Update of a Node
           This example forces the update of the node sj01 to enable the node
           to communicate over SSH.

               asadmin> update-node-ssh --force sj01
               Warning: some parameters appear to be invalid.
               Could not connect to host sj01 using SSH.
               Could not authenticate. Tried authenticating with specified key at
               /home/gfuser/.ssh/id_rsa
               Continuing with node update due to use of --force.
               Command update-node-ssh executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
