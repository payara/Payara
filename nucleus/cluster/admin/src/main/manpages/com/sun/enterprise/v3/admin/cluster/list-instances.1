list-instances(1)         asadmin Utility Subcommands        list-instances(1)

NAME
       list-instances - lists GlassFish Server instances in a domain

SYNOPSIS
           list-instances [--help] [--timeoutmsec timeout]
           [--long={false|true} | --nostatus={false|true}]
           [--standaloneonly={false|true} | target]

DESCRIPTION
       The list-instances subcommand lists GlassFish Server instances in a
       domain. The list can be filtered by cluster, instance, node, or
       configuration.

       The subcommand displays every GlassFish Server instance in the
       specified target, regardless of how each instance was created. For
       example, this subcommand lists instances that were created by using the
       create-instance(1) subcommand and by using the create-local-instance(1)
       subcommand.

       By default, the subcommand indicates whether each instance that is
       listed is running. Options of this subcommand control the information
       that is displayed for each instance.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --timeoutmsec
           The time limit in milliseconds for determining the status of
           instances. The default is 2,000, which is equivalent to 2 seconds.

       --long, -l
           Specifies whether detailed information is displayed for each
           instance that is listed.

           The --long option and --nostatus option are mutually exclusive. If
           both options are specified in the same command, an error occurs.

           Valid values are as follows:

           true
               The following details are displayed for each instance that is
               listed:

               *   The name of the instance

               *   The name of the host where the instance's node resides

               *   The HTTP port on which the instance listens for
                   administration requests

               *   The process identifier (PID) of the instance process or -1
                   if the instance is not running

               *   The name of the cluster of which the instance is a member,
                   if any

               *   The state of the instance, which is running or not running

                   When an instance is listed, some configuration changes in
                   the domain administration server (DAS) for the instance
                   might not have been applied to the instance itself. In this
                   situation, the commands that are required to apply the
                   changes are listed adjacent to the state of the instance.
                   The maximum number of commands that are listed for an
                   instance is 10.

           false
               Only the name of the instance and an indication of whether the
               instance is running are displayed (default). The length of time
               that the instance has been running is not displayed.

       --nostatus
           Specifies whether information about whether instances are running
           is suppressed.

           The --long option and --nostatus option are mutually exclusive. If
           both options are specified in the same command, an error occurs.

           Valid values are as follows:

           true
               Information about whether instances are running is suppressed.
               Only the name of each instance is displayed.

           false
               Information about whether instances are running is displayed
               (default).

       --standaloneonly
           Specifies whether only standalone instances are listed.

           The --standaloneonly option and the target operand and are mutually
           exclusive. If both the --standaloneonly option and the target
           operand are specified in the same command, an error occurs.

           Valid values are as follows:

           true
               Only standalone instances are listed.

           false
               All instances in the specified target are listed (default).

OPERANDS
       target
           Filters the list of GlassFish Server instances by specifying the
           target for which instances are listed.

           The target operand and the --standaloneonly option are mutually
           exclusive. If both the target operand and the --standaloneonly
           option are specified in the same command, an error occurs.

           Valid values are as follows:

           domain
               Lists all instances in the domain (default).

           cluster-name
               Lists the instances that are members of the specified cluster.

           instance-name
               Lists only the specified instance.

           node-name
               Lists the instances that reside on the specified node.

           configuration-name
               Lists all instances whose configuration is defined by the
               specified named configuration.
