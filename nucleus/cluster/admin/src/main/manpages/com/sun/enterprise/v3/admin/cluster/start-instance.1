start-instance(1)         asadmin Utility Subcommands        start-instance(1)

NAME
       start-instance - starts a GlassFish Server instance

SYNOPSIS
           start-instance [--help]
           [--debug={false|true}] [--sync={normal|full|none}]
           instance-name

DESCRIPTION
       The start-instance subcommand starts a GlassFish Server instance. This
       subcommand requires the secure shell (SSH) to be configured on the machine
       where the domain administration server (DAS) is running and on the
       machine where the instance resides.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           SSH is not required          |
           |           if the instance resides on a |
           |           node of type CONFIG that     |
           |           represents the local host. A |
           |           node of type CONFIG is not   |
           |           enabled for remote           |
           |           communication over SSH.      |
           +----------------------------------------+

       You may run this subcommand from any machine that can contact the DAS.

       The subcommand can start any GlassFish Server instance, regardless of
       how the instance was created. For example, this subcommand can start an
       instance that was created by using the create-local-instance(1)
       subcommand.

       This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --debug
           Specifies whether the instance is started with Java Platform
           Debugger Architecture (JPDA)

           (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/jpda-141715.html)

           debugging enabled.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The instance is started with JPDA debugging enabled and the
               port number for JPDA debugging is displayed.

           false
               The instance is started with JPDA debugging disabled (default).

       --sync
           The type of synchronization between the DAS and the instance's
           files when the instance is started.

           Possible values are as follows:

           none
               The DAS does not synchronize the instance's files with any
               changes. This type of synchronization minimizes the time that
               is required to start the instance.

           normal
               The DAS synchronizes the instance with changes since the last
               synchronization as follows:

               *   For the config directory, the DAS synchronizes the instance
                   with all changes.

               *   For the applications directory and docroot directory, only
                   a change to a top-level subdirectory causes the DAS to
                   synchronize all files under that subdirectory.

                   If a file below a top level subdirectory is changed without
                   a change to a file in the top level subdirectory, full
                   synchronization is required. In normal operation, files
                   below the top level subdirectories of these directories are
                   not changed. If an application is deployed and undeployed,
                   full synchronization is not necessary to update the
                   instance with the change.

               This value is the default.

           full
               The DAS synchronizes the instance with all of the instance's
               files, regardless of whether the files have changed since the
               last synchronization. This type of synchronization might delay
               the startup of the instance while the DAS updates all files in
               the instance's directories.

OPERANDS
       instance-name
           The name of the GlassFish Server instance to start.
