list-nodes(1)             asadmin Utility Subcommands            list-nodes(1)

NAME
       list-nodes - lists all GlassFish Server nodes in a domain

SYNOPSIS
           list-nodes [--help] [--long={false|true}]

DESCRIPTION
       The list-nodes subcommand lists all GlassFish Server nodes in a domain.

       By default, the subcommand displays the following information for each
       node that is listed:

       *   The name of the node

       *   The type of the node, which is one of the following types:

           CONFIG
               The node does not support remote communication.

           SSH
               The node supports communication over secure shell (SSH).

       *   The name of the host that the node represents

       The --long option of the subcommand specifies whether the nodes are
       listed in long format. In long format, the following additional
       information about each node is displayed:

       *   The path to the parent of the base installation directory of
           GlassFish Server on the host that the node represents

       *   A comma-separated list of the names of the GlassFish Server
           instances that reside on the node

       If the --terse option of the asadmin(1M) utility is true and the --long
       option of the subcommand is false, the subcommand lists only the name
       of each node.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --long, -l
           Specifies whether the nodes are listed in long format.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The nodes are listed in long format.

           false
               The nodes are listed in short format (default).

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Listing GlassFish Server Nodes
           This example displays the name, type, and host for all GlassFish
           Server nodes in the domain domain1.

               asadmin> list-nodes
               localhost-domain1  CONFIG  localhost
               sj02  SSH  sj02.example.com
               sj01  SSH  sj01.example.com
               devnode  CONFIG  localhost
               Command list-nodes executed successfully.

       Example 2, Listing Only the Names of GlassFish Server Nodes
           This example uses the --terse option of the asadmin utility to list
           only the names of the GlassFish Server nodes in the domain domain1.

               asadmin> list-nodes --terse=true
               localhost-domain1
               sj02
               sj01
               devnode

       Example 3, Listing GlassFish Server Nodes in Long Format
           This example lists the GlassFish Server nodes in the domain domain1
           in long format.

               asadmin> list-nodes --long=true
               NODE NAME           TYPE     NODE HOST          INSTALL DIRECTORY     REFERENCED BY
               localhost-domain1   CONFIG   localhost          /export/glassfish3
               sj02                SSH      sj02.example.com   /export/glassfish3    pmd-i2, yml-i2
               sj01                SSH      sj01.example.com   /export/glassfish3    pmd-i1, yml-i1
               devnode             CONFIG   localhost          /export/glassfish3    pmdsa1
               Command list-nodes executed successfully.
