delete-instance(1)        asadmin Utility Subcommands       delete-instance(1)

NAME
       delete-instance - deletes a GlassFish Server instance

SYNOPSIS
           delete-instance [--help] instance-name

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-instance subcommand deletes a GlassFish Server instance.
       This subcommand requires the secure shell (SSH) to be configured on the host
       where the domain administration server (DAS) is running and on the host
       that is represented by the node where the instance resides.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           SSH is not required          |
           |           if the instance resides on a |
           |           node of type CONFIG that     |
           |           represents the local host. A |
           |           node of type CONFIG is not   |
           |           enabled for remote           |
           |           communication over SSH.      |
           +----------------------------------------+

       You may run this subcommand from any host that can contact the DAS.

       The subcommand can delete any GlassFish Server instance, regardless of
       how the instance was created. For example, this subcommand can delete
       an instance that was created by using the create-local-instance(1)
       subcommand.

       The instance that is being deleted must not be running. Otherwise, an
       error occurs.

       The subcommand deletes an instance by performing the following actions:

       *   Removing the instance from the configuration of the domain
           administration server (DAS)

       *   Deleting the instance's files from file system

       If the instance that is being deleted is the only instance that is
       using the node directory, that directory is also removed.

       If a standalone instance is deleted, the instance's standalone
       configuration is also deleted. A standalone instance refers to a
       configuration that is named instance-name-config to which no other
       clusters or unclustered instances refer.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

OPERANDS
