list-nodes-config(1)      asadmin Utility Subcommands     list-nodes-config(1)

NAME
       list-nodes-config - lists all GlassFish Server nodes that do not
       support remote communication in a domain

SYNOPSIS
           list-nodes-config [--help] [--long={false|true}]

DESCRIPTION
       The list-nodes-config subcommand lists all GlassFish Server nodes that
       do not support remote communication in a domain.

           Note
           +-------------------------------------+
           |           To list all nodes in a    |
           |           domain regardless of the  |
           |           type of the node, run the |
           |           list-nodes(1) subcommand. |
           +-------------------------------------+

       By default, the subcommand displays the following information for each
       node that is listed:

       *   The name of the node

       *   The type of the node, which is CONFIG

       *   The name of the host that the node represents

       The --long option of the subcommand specifies whether the nodes are
       listed in long format. In long format, the following additional
       information about each node is displayed:

       *   The path to the parent of the base installation directory of
           GlassFish Server on the host that the node represents

       *   A comma-separated list of the names of the GlassFish Server
           instances that reside on the node

       If the --terse option of the asadmin(1M) utility is true and the --long
       option of the subcommand is false, the subcommand lists only the name
       of each node.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --long, -l
           Specifies whether the nodes are listed in long format.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The nodes are listed in long format.

           false
               The nodes are listed in short format (default).

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Listing GlassFish Server Nodes
           This example displays the name, type, and host for all GlassFish
           Server nodes that do not support remote communication in the domain
           domain1.

               asadmin> list-nodes-config
               localhost-domain1  CONFIG  localhost
               devnode  CONFIG  localhost
               Command list-nodes-config executed successfully.

       Example 2, Listing Only the Names of GlassFish Server Nodes
           This example uses the --terse option of the asadmin utility to list
           only the names of the GlassFish Server nodes that do not support
           remote communication in the domain domain1.

               asadmin> list-nodes-config --terse=true
               localhost-domain1
               devnode

       Example 3, Listing GlassFish Server Nodes in Long Format
           This example lists the GlassFish Server nodes that do not support
           remote communication in the domain domain1in long format.

               asadmin> list-nodes-config --long=true
               NODE NAME           TYPE     NODE HOST   INSTALL DIRECTORY    REFERENCED BY
               localhost-domain1   CONFIG   localhost   /export/glassfish3
               devnode             CONFIG   localhost   /export/glassfish3   pmdsa1
               Command list-nodes-config executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
