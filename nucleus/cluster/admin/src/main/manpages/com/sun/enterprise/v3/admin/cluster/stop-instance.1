NAME
       stop-instance - stops a running GlassFish Server instance

SYNOPSIS
           stop-instance [--help]
           [--force={false|true}] [--kill={false|true}]
           instance-name

DESCRIPTION
       The stop-instance subcommand stops a running GlassFish Server instance.

       The subcommand can stop any GlassFish Server instance, regardless of
       how the instance was created. For example, this subcommand can stop an
       instance that was created by using the create-local-instance(1)
       subcommand.

       This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --force
           Specifies whether the instance is forcibly stopped immediately.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The instance is forcibly stopped immediately (default).

           false
               The subcommand waits until all threads that are associated with
               the instance are exited before stopping the instance.

       --kill
           Specifies whether the instance is killed by using functionality of
           the operating system to terminate the instance process.

           Possible values are as follows:

           false
               The instance is not killed. The subcommand uses functionality
               of the Java platform to terminate the instance process
               (default).

           true
               The instance is killed. The subcommand uses functionality of
               the operating system to terminate the instance process.
