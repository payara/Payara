list-clusters(1)          asadmin Utility Subcommands         list-clusters(1)

NAME
       list-clusters - lists existing clusters in a domain

SYNOPSIS
           list-clusters [--help] [target]

DESCRIPTION
       The list-clusters subcommand lists existing clusters in a domain. The
       list can be filtered by cluster, instance, node, or configuration. For
       each cluster that is listed, the subcommand indicates whether the
       cluster is running.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

OPERANDS
       target
           Filters the list of clusters by specifying the target for which the
           clusters are to be listed. Valid values are as follows:

           domain
               Lists all clusters in the domain (default).

           cluster-name
               Lists only the specified cluster.

           instance-name
               Lists the cluster of which the specified instance is a member.

           node-name
               Lists the clusters that contain an instance that resides on the
               specified node. For example, if instance pmdi1 in cluster pmdc
               and instance ymli1 in cluster ymlc reside on node n1, pmdc and
               ymlc are listed.

           configuration-name
               Lists all clusters that contain instances whose configuration
               is defined by the named configuration.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Listing All Clusters in a Domain
           This example lists all clusters in the current domain.

               asadmin> list-clusters
               pmdclust not running
               ymlclust not running

               Command list-clusters executed successfully.

       Example 2, Displaying the Status of a Cluster
           This example displays status of the cluster ymlclust, which is not
           running.

               asadmin> list-clusters ymlclust
               ymlclust not running

               Command list-clusters executed successfully.

       Example 3, Listing All Clusters That Are Associated With a Node
           This example lists the clusters that contain an instance that
           resides on the node sj02.

               asadmin> list-clusters sj02
               ymlclust not running

               Command list-clusters executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
