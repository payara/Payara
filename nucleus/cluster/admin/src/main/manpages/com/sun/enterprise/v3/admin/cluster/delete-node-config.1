delete-node-config(1)     asadmin Utility Subcommands    delete-node-config(1)

NAME
       delete-node-config - deletes a node that is not enabled for remote
       communication

SYNOPSIS
           delete-node-config [--help] node-name

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-node-config subcommand deletes a node that is not enabled
       for remote communication from the domain. This subcommand does not
       require the secure shell (SSH) to be configured.

       This subcommand can delete only a node that is not enabled for remote
       communication. The subcommand for deleting other types of nodes depends
       on the type of the node:

       *   A node that is enabled for remote communication over SSH must be
           deleted by using the delete-node-ssh(1) subcommand.

       To determine whether a node is enabled for remote communication, use
       the list-nodes(1) subcommand.

       No GlassFish Server instances must reside on the node that is being
       deleted. Otherwise, the subcommand fails. Before running this
       subcommand, delete any instances that reside on the node by using, for
       example, the delete-instance(1) subcommand or the
       delete-local-instance(1) subcommand.

           Note

           |           deleted.                   |

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPERANDS
