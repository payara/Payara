NAME
       export-sync-bundle - exports the configuration data of a cluster or
       standalone instance to an archive file

SYNOPSIS
           export-sync-bundle [--help]
           --target target
           [--retrieve={false|true}]
           [file-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The export-sync-bundle subcommand exports the configuration data of a
       cluster or standalone instance to an archive file. The archive file can
       then be used with the import-sync-bundle(1) subcommand to restore the
       configuration data.

       Importing an instance's configuration data transfers the data to a host
       for an instance without the need for the instance to be able to
       communicate with the domain administration server (DAS). Importing an
       instance's configuration data is typically required for the following
       reasons:

       *   To reestablish the instance after an upgrade

       *   To synchronize the instance manually with the DAS when the instance
           cannot contact the DAS

       The subcommand creates an archive that contains the following files and
       directories in the current domain directory:

       *   All the files in the following directories:

           *   config

           *   docroot

       *   The entire contents of the following directories and their
           subdirectories:

           *   applications

           *   config/target, where target is the instance for which
               configuration data is being exported

           *   generated

           *   lib

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           The cluster or standalone instance for which to export
           configuration data. The --target option is required.

           This option must not specify a clustered GlassFish Server instance.
           If this option specifies a clustered instance, an error occurs. To
           export configuration data for a clustered instance, specify the
           name of the cluster of which the instance is a member, not the
           instance.

       --retrieve
           Specifies whether the archive file is downloaded from the DAS host
           to the host where the subcommand is run.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The archive file is downloaded to the host where the subcommand
               is run.

           false
               The archive file is not downloaded and remains on the DAS host
               (default).

OPERANDS
       file-name
           The file name and location of the archive file to which to export
           the data.

           The default depends on the setting of the --retrieve option:

           *   If --retrieve is false, the default is
               sync/target-sync-bundle.zip in the current domain directory.

           *   If --retrieve is true, the default is target-sync-bundle.zip in
               the current working directory.

           target is the cluster or standalone instance that the --target
           option specifies.

           If a relative path is specified, the directory to which the path is
           appended depends on the setting of the --retrieve option:

           *   If --retrieve is false, the path is appended to the config
               subdirectory of the current domain directory.

           *   If --retrieve is true, the path is appended to the current
               working directory.

           If an existing directory is specified without a filename, the file
           name of the archive file is target-sync-bundle.zip, where target is
           the cluster or standalone instance that the --target option
           specifies.
