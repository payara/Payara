DESCRIPTION
       The stop-cluster subcommand stops a GlassFish Server cluster by

           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --verbose
           Specifies whether additional progress messages about the status of
           instances in the cluster are displayed while the cluster is being
           stopped.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               Additional progress messages about the status of instances in
               the cluster are displayed.

           false
               No messages about the status of instances in the cluster are
               displayed.

       --kill
           Specifies whether each instance in the cluster is killed by using
           functionality of the operating system to terminate the instance

           out.

       --instancetimeout
           Specifies the amount of time in seconds each instance will attempt to shutdown
           before timing out.
