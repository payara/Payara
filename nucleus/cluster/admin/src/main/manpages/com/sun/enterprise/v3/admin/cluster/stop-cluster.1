SYNOPSIS
           stop-cluster [--help]
           [--verbose={false|true}]

DESCRIPTION
       The stop-cluster subcommand stops a GlassFish Server cluster by
       stopping all running GlassFish Server instances in the cluster.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --verbose
           Specifies whether additional progress messages about the status of
           instances in the cluster are displayed while the cluster is being
           stopped.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               Additional progress messages about the status of instances in
               the cluster are displayed.

           false
               No messages about the status of instances in the cluster are
               displayed.

       --kill
           Specifies whether each instance in the cluster is killed by using
           functionality of the operating system to terminate the instance
           process.

           Possible values are as follows:

           false
               No instances are killed. The subcommand uses functionality of
               the Java platform to terminate each instance process (default).

           true
               Each instance is killed. The subcommand uses functionality of
               the operating system to terminate each instance process.

       --autohadboverride
           Do not specify this option. This option is retained for
           compatibility with earlier releases. If you specify this option, a
           syntax error does not occur. Instead, the subcommand runs
           successfully and displays a warning message that the option is
           ignored.

OPERANDS
       cluster-name
           The name of the cluster to stop.
