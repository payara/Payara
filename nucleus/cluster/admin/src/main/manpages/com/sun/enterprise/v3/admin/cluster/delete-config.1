NAME
       delete-config - deletes an existing named configuration

SYNOPSIS
           delete-config [--help] configuration-name

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-config subcommand deletes an existing named configuration
       from the configuration of the domain administration server (DAS). You
       can delete a configuration only if no GlassFish Server instances or
       clusters refer to the configuration. A standalone configuration is
       automatically deleted when the instance or cluster that refers to it is
       deleted. You cannot delete the default-config configuration that is
       copied to create standalone configurations.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
