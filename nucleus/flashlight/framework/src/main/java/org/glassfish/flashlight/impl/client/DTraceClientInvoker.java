/**

 * DTraceClientInvoker is only public because an internal class is using it from a
 * different package.  If this were C++ we would have a "friend" relationship between
 * the 2 classes.  In Java we are stuck with making it public.
 * Notes:
 * DTrace has a fairly serious limitation.  It only allows parameters that are
 * integral primitives (all primitives except float and double) and java.lang.String
 * So what we do is automagically convert other class objects to String via Object.toString()
 * This brings in a new rub with overloaded methods.  E.g. we can't tell apart these 2 methods:
 * foo(Date) and foo(String)
 *
 * TODO:I believe we should disallow such overloads when the DTrace object is being produced rather than
 * worrying about it in this class.
