enable-monitoring(1)      asadmin Utility Subcommands     enable-monitoring(1)

NAME
       enable-monitoring - enables monitoring for the server or for specific
       monitorable modules

SYNOPSIS
           enable-monitoring [--help]
           [--target target]
           [--mbean={false|true}]
           [--dtrace={true|false}]
           [--modules modules[=level][:module[=level]]*
           [--pid pid]
           [--options options]]

DESCRIPTION
       The enable-monitoring subcommand is used to turn on monitoring for
       GlassFish Server or for particular modules during runtime. Changes are
       dynamic, that is, server restart is not required.

       By default, the monitoring service is enabled, that is, the
       monitoring-enabled attribute of the monitoring-service element is true.
       However, the default monitoring level for individual modules is OFF.
       This subcommand used with the --modules option can enable monitoring
       for a given module by setting the monitoring level to HIGH or LOW. If
       level is not specified when running the subcommand, the level defaults
       to HIGH.

       The specific meanings of HIGH or LOW are determined by the individual
       containers. For a list of monitorable modules, see the --modules option
       in this help page.

       An alternative method for enabling monitoring is to use the set
       subcommand. In this case, the server must be restarted for changes to
       take effect.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target on which to enabling monitoring. Valid values
           are as follows:

           server
               Enables monitoring for the default server instance server and
               is the default value.

           configuration-name
               Enables monitoring for the named configuration.

           cluster-name
               Enables monitoring for every server instance in the cluster.

           instance-name
               Enables monitoring for a particular server instance.

       --mbean
           Enables Mbean monitoring. Default value is false.

       --dtrace
           Only usable if the DTrace Monitoring module is present. Enables
           Oracle Solaris DTrace monitoring. Default value is false.

       --modules
           Enables specified module or modules by indicating monitoring level.
           Valid levels are OFF, HIGH, LOW. If level is not specified, the
           default setting is HIGH. Multiple modules are separated by :
           (colon). Monitorable modules include connector-connection-pool,
           connector-service, ejb-container, http-service,
           jdbc-connection-pool, jersey, jpa, jms-service, jvm, security,
           thread-pool, transaction-service, web-container, and
           web-services-container. Additional modules can be listed by using
           the get subcommand.

       --pid
           Specifies the GlassFish Server JVM process identifier (PID). When
           monitoring is enabled, the btrace-agent is attached, based on the
           specified PID. Need to specify only in exceptional cases when the
           system cannot determine the PID. In this situation, the subcommand
           prompts for the PID of the corresponding GlassFish Serverprocess.

       --options
           Sets the following btrace-agent options:

           debug
               Enables debugging for BTrace. Default value is false.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Enabling the Monitoring Service for GlassFish Server
           This example enables monitoring for GlassFish Server in general by
           setting the enable-monitoring flag to true (default is true).

               asadmin> enable-monitoring
               Command enable-monitoring executed successfully

       Example 2, Enabling Monitoring for the Web and EJB Containers
           This example enables monitoring for specific containers by setting
           their monitoring levels.

               asadmin> enable-monitoring --modules web-container=LOW:ejb-container=HIGH
               Command enable-monitoring executed successfully

       Example 3, Turning on Debugging for Monitoring
           This example turns on debugging.

               asadmin> enable-monitoring --options debug=true
               Command enable-monitoring executed successfully

EXIT STATUS
       0
           subcommand executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the subcommand
