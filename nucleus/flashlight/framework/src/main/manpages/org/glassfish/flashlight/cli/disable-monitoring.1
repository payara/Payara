disable-monitoring(1)     asadmin Utility Subcommands    disable-monitoring(1)

NAME
       disable-monitoring - disables monitoring for the server or for specific
       monitorable modules

SYNOPSIS
           disable-monitoring [--help] [--modules module-name][:module-name]*

DESCRIPTION
       The disable-monitoring subcommand is used to turn off monitoring for
       GlassFish Server or for particular modules during runtime. Changes are
       dynamic, that is, server restart is not required.

       Running the disable-monitoring subcommand without the --module option
       disables the monitoring service by setting the monitoring-enabled
       attribute of the monitoring-service element to false. The individual
       modules retain their monitoring levels, but no monitoring data is
       generated because the entire monitoring service is disabled.

       This subcommand used with the --modules option disables monitoring for
       a module by setting the monitoring level to OFF. The status of the
       monitoring service is not affected. For a list of monitorable modules,
       see the --modules option in this help page.

       An alternative method for disabling monitoring is to use the set
       subcommand. In this case, the server must be restarted for changes to
       take effect.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --modules
           Disables the specified module or modules by setting the monitoring
           level to OFF. Multiple modules are separated by : (colon).
           Monitorable modules include connector-connection-pool,
           connector-service, ejb-container, http-service,
           jdbc-connection-pool, jersey, jpa, jms-service, jvm, security,
           thread-pool, transaction-service, web-container, and
           web-services-container. Additional modules can be listed by using
           the get subcommand.
