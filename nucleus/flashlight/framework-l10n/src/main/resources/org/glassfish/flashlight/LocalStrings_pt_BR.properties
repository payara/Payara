no_impl=DTrace n\u00E3o est\u00E1 dispon\u00EDvel.  Isso pode ser causado por dois motivos:\n1. JDK 7 \u00E9 necess\u00E1rio para executar DTrace\n2. glassfish-dtrace.jar value-add \u00E9 necess\u00E1rio para DTrace
not_supported=DTrace n\u00E3o est\u00E1 dispon\u00EDvel.  Geralmente essa condi\u00E7\u00E3o ocorre somente quando seu\nSistema Operacional n\u00E3o oferece suporte a DTrace.  Atualmente voc\u00EA deve ter o Solaris 10\nou superior para ter suporte ao dtrace.
init_ok=DTrace est\u00E1 conectado e pronto.
