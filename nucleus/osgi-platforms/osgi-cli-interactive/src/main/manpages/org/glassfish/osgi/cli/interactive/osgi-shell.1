osgi-shell(1)             asadmin Utility Subcommands            osgi-shell(1)

NAME
       osgi-shell - provides interactive access to the Apache Felix Gogo
       remote shell for the execution of OSGi shell commands

SYNOPSIS
           osgi-shell [--help]
           [--file file]
           [--printprompt={false|true}]
           [--encoding encoding]

DESCRIPTION
       The osgi-shell subcommand provides interactive access to the Apache
       Felix Gogo remote shell for the execution of OSGi shell commands. The
       remote shell is provided with GlassFish Server and used to administer
       and inspect the OSGi runtime.

       OSGi shell commands are executed on the server and results are printed
       on the client. Because the shell is interactive, no operands are
       accepted. Scripting is supported, which means that multiple commands
       can be executed in sequence from a text file.

       A related subcommand is the osgi subcommand, which passes a single
       command to the remote shell for execution. Results are returned by the
       asadmin utility. For more information about the osgi subcommand, see
       the osgi(1) help page.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only. Unlike other local
       subcommands, however, the domain administration server (DAS) and the
       server instance whose shell is being accessed must be running.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --file, -f
           Reads the commands in the specified file.

       --printprompt
           Controls printing of the shell prompt. The default value is true,
           which means the shell prompt is displayed.

       --encoding
           Specifies the character set for the file to be decoded. By default,
           the system character set is used.
