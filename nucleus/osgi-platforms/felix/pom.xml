<!--
  This module is meant to create a distribution fragement that contains
  Apache Felix and associated configuration files and bundles.
  The layout relative to glassfish root looks like this:
  osgi/
    felix/
       bin/
          felix.jar
       conf/
          osgi.properties
  modules/
       [org.apache.felix.*]
       autostart/
          [org.apache.felix.scr.jar]

   This is more or less how the layout would look if one downloads the Felix
   distribution from Felix project and installs. The only difference being we keep
   the bundles in glassfish/modules dir as opposed to bundle dir in felix.
