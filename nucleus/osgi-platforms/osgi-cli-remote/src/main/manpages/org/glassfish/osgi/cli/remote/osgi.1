osgi(1)                   asadmin Utility Subcommands                  osgi(1)

NAME
       osgi - delegates the command line to the Apache Felix Gogo remote shell
       for the execution of OSGi shell commands

SYNOPSIS
           osgi [--help]
           [--session session]
           [--session-id session-id]
           [--instance instance]
           [command_line]

DESCRIPTION
       The osgi subcommand delegates the command line to the Apache Felix Gogo
       remote shell for the execution of OSGi shell commands. Commands are
       executed by the remote shell and results are returned by the asadmin
       utility. The remote shell is provided with GlassFish Server and used to
       administer and inspect the OSGi runtime.

       Multiple command-line sessions can be created. Use the --session and
       --session-id options to run commands in a specific command-line
       session. If no session is specified, a new session is created to run
       commands and closed when execution completes.

       A related subcommand is the osgi-shell subcommand, which enables you to
       run multiple commands from a file or run commands interactively. For
       more information about the osgi-shell subcommand, see the osgi-shell(1)
       help page.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the osgi subcommand.

       --session
           Performs command-line session operations. Valid values are:

           new
               Creates a new session and returns a session ID.

           stop
               Stops the session with the specified session ID.

           list
               Lists all active sessions.

           execute
               Runs a command in the session with the specified session ID.

       --session-id
           Specifies the session ID for command-line session operations.

       --instance
           Specifies the server instance to which the command is being
           delegated.

           The default is the domain administration server (DAS). The DAS must
           be running to run a command on another instance.

OPERANDS
       command_line
           The complete command-line syntax as provided for commands in the
           Apache Felix Gogo remote shell.
