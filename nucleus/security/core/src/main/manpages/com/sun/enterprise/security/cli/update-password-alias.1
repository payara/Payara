NAME
       update-password-alias - updates a password alias

SYNOPSIS
           update-password-alias [--help]
            aliasname

DESCRIPTION
       This subcommand updates the password alias IDs in the named target. An
       alias is a token of the form ${ALIAS=password-alias-password}. The
       password corresponding to the alias name is stored in an encrypted
       form. The update-password-alias subcommand takes both a secure
       interactive form (in which the user is prompted for all information)
       and a more script-friendly form, in which the password is propagated on
       the command line.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
