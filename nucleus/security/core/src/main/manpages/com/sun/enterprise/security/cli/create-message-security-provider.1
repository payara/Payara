DESCRIPTION
       The create-message-security-provider subcommand enables the
       administrator to create a message security provider for the security
       service which specifies how SOAP messages will be secured.

       This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       If an option has a short option name, then the short option precedes
       the long option name. Short options have one dash whereas long options
       have two dashes.

       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which you are creating the message
           security provider. The following values are valid:

           server
               Creates the provider for the default server instance server and
               is the default value.

           domain
               Creates the provider for the domain.

           instance_name
               Creates the provider for a particular sever instance.

       --classname
           Defines the Java implementation class of the provider. Client
           authentication providers must implement the com.sun.enterprise.
           security.jauth.ClientAuthModule interface. Server-side providers
           must implement the com.sun.enterprise.security
           jauth.ServerAuthModule interface. A provider may implement both
           interfaces, but it must implement the interface corresponding to
           its provider type.

       --layer
           The message-layer entity used to define the value of the auth-layer
           attribute of message-security-config elements. The default is
           HttpServlet. Another option is SOAP.

       --providertype
           Establishes whether the provider is to be used as client
           authentication provider, server authentication provider, or both.
           Valid options for this property include client, server, or
           client-server.

       --requestauthsource
           The auth-source attribute defines a requirement for message-layer
           sender authentication (e.g. username password) or content
           authentication (e.g. digital signature) to be applied to request
           messages. Possible values are sender or content. When this argument
           is not specified, source authentication of the request is not
           required.

       --requestauthrecipient
           The auth-recipient attribute defines a requirement for
           message-layer authentication of the receiver of a message to its
           sender (e.g. by XML encryption). Possible values are before-content
           or after-content. The default value is after-content.

       --responseauthsource
           The auth-source attribute defines a requirement for message-layer
           sender authentication (e.g. username password) or content
           authentication (e.g. digital signature) to be applied to response
           messages. Possible values are sender or content. When this option
           is not specified, source authentication of the response is not
           required.

       --responseauthrecipient
           The auth-recipient attribute defines a requirement for
           message-layer authentication of the receiver of the response
           message to its sender (e.g. by XML encryption). Possible values are
           before-content or after-content. The default value is
           after-content.

       --isdefaultprovider
           The default-provider attribute is used to designate the provider as
           the default provider (at the layer) of the type or types identified
           by the providertype argument. There is no default associated with
           this option.

       --property
           Use this property to pass provider-specific property values to the
           provider when it is initialized. Properties passed in this way
           might include key aliases to be used by the provider to get keys
           from keystores, signing, canonicalization, encryption algorithms,
           etc.

           The following properties may be set:

           security.config
               Specifies the location of the message security configuration
               file. To point to a configuration file in the domain-dir/config
               directory, use the system property
               ${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/config/, for example:
               ${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/config/wss-server-config-1.0.xml.
               The default is domain-dir/config/ wss-serverconfig-1.0.xml.

           debug
               If true, enables dumping of server provider debug messages to
               the server log. The default is false.

           dynamic.username. password
               If true, signals the provider runtime to collect the user name
               and password from the CallbackHandler for each request. If
               false, the user name and password for wsse:UsernameToken(s) is
               collected once, during module initialization. This property is
               only applicable for a ClientAuthModule. The default is false.

           encryption.key.alias
               Specifies the encryption key used by the provider. The key is
               identified by its keystore alias. The default value is s1as.

           signature.key.alias
               Specifies the signature key used by the provider. The key is
               identified by its keystore alias. The default value is s1as.

OPERANDS
       provider_name
           The name of the provider used to reference the provider-config
           element.
