create-file-user(1)       asadmin Utility Subcommands      create-file-user(1)

NAME
       create-file-user - creates a new file user

SYNOPSIS
           create-file-user [--help] [--authrealmnameauth_realm_name]
           [--target target
           [--groups user_groups[:user_groups]*] user_name

DESCRIPTION
       The create-file-user subcommand creates an entry in the keyfile with
       the specified username, password, and groups. Multiple groups can be
       created by separating them with a colon (:). If auth_realm_name is not
       specified, an entry is created in the keyfile for the default realm. If
       auth_realm_name is specified, an entry is created in the keyfile using
       the auth_realm_name.

       You can use the --passwordfile option of the asadmin(1M) command to
       specify the password for the user. The password file entry must be of
       the form AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD=user-password.

       If a password is not provided, this subcommand fails if secure
       administration is enabled and the user being created is an
       administrative user.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

           This is the group associated with this file user.

       --authrealmname
           The name of the realm in which the new user is created. If you do
           not specify this option, the user is created in the "file" realm.
