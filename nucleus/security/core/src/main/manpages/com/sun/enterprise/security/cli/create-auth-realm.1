NAME
       create-auth-realm - adds the named authentication realm

SYNOPSIS
           create-auth-realm --classname realm_class [--help] [--property(name=value)[:name=value]*]
           [--target target_name] auth_realm_name

DESCRIPTION
       The create-auth-realm subcommand adds the named authentication realm.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target on which you are creating the realm. Valid
           values are

           server
               Creates the realm on the default server instance. This is the
               default value.

           configuration_name
               Creates the realm in the specified configuration.

           instance_name
               Creates the realm on a specified server instance.

       --classname
           Java class which implements this realm. These include
           com.sun.enterprise.security.auth.realm.file.FileRealm,
           com.sun.enterprise.security.auth.realm.certificate.CertificateRealm,
           com.sun.enterprise.security.auth.realm.jdbc.JDBCRealm,
           com.sun.enterprise.security.auth.realm.ldap.LDAPRealm,
           com.sun.enterprise.security.auth.realm.ldap.PamRealm, and
           com.sun.enterprise.security.auth.realm.solaris.SolarisRealm, or a
           custom realm.

       --property
           Optional attribute name-value pairs for configuring the
           authentication realm. Authentication realms require
           provider-specific properties, which vary based on implementation.

           The following properties are common to all of the supported realms,
           which include FileRealm, CertificateRealm, JDBCRealm, LDAPRealm,
           PamRealm, and SolarisRealm.

           jaas-context
               Specifies the Java Authentication and Authorization Service
               (JAAS) context.

           assign-groups
               (Optional) If this property is set, its value is taken to be a
               comma-separated list of group names. All clients who present
               valid certificates are assigned membership to these groups for
               the purposes of authorization decisions in the web and EJB
               containers.

           Specific to each realm, you can specify the following properties.

           *   You can specify the following properties for FileRealm:

               file
                   Specifies the file that stores user names, passwords, and
                   group names. The default is domain-dir/config/keyfile.

           *   You can specify the following properties for CertificateRealm:

               LoginModule
                   Specifies the name of a JAAS LoginModule to use for
                   performing authentication. To use a JAAS LoginModule, you
                   must first create an implementation of the
                   javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule interface, and then
                   plug the module into a jaas-context. For more information,
                   see "Custom Authentication of Client Certificate in SSL
                   Mutual Authentication" in Oracle GlassFish Server Security
                   Guide.

           *   You can specify the following properties for JDBCRealm:

               datasource-jndi
                   Specifies the jndi-name of the jdbc-resource for the
                   database.

               user-table
                   Specifies the name of the user table in the database.

               user-name-column
                   Specifies the name of the user name column in the
                   database's user table.

               password-column
                   Specifies the name of the password column in the database's
                   user table.

               group-table
                   Specifies the name of the group table in the database.

               group-table
                   Specify the group table for an authentication realm of
                   class JDBCRealm.

               group-name-column
                   Specifies the name of the group name column in the
                   database's group table.

               db-user
                   (Optional) Allows you to specify the database user name in
                   the realm instead of the jdbc-connection-pool. This
                   prevents other applications from looking up the database,
                   getting a connection, and browsing the user table. By
                   default, the jdbc-connection-pool configuration is used.

               db-password
                   (Optional) Allows you to specify the database password in
                   the realm instead of the jdbc-connection-pool. This
                   prevents other applications from looking up the database,
                   getting a connection, and browsing the user table. By
                   default, the jdbc-connection-pool configuration is used.

               group-table
                   Specifies the name of the group table in the database.

               digest-algorithm
                   (Optional) Specifies the digest algorithm. The default is
                   SHA-256. You can use any algorithm supported in the JDK, or
                   none.

               digestrealm-password-enc-algorithm
                   (Optional) Specifies the algorithm for encrypting passwords
                   stored in the database.

                       Note
                       +---------------------------------------+
                       |It is a security risk not to specify a |
                       |password encryption algorithm.         |
                       +---------------------------------------+

               encoding
                   (Optional) Specifies the encoding. Allowed values are Hex
                   and Base64. If digest-algorithm is specified, the default
                   is Hex. If digest-algorithm is not specified, by default no
                   encoding is specified.

               charset
                   (Optional) Specifies the charset for the digest algorithm.

           *   You can specify the following properties for LDAPRealm:

               directory
                   Specifies the LDAP URL to your server.

               base-dn
                   Specifies the LDAP base DN for the location of user data.
                   This base DN can be at any level above the user data, since
                   a tree scope search is performed. The smaller the search
                   tree, the better the performance.

               search-filter
                   (Optional) Specifies the search filter to use to find the
                   user. The default is uid=%s (%s expands to the subject
                   name).

               group-base-dn
                   (Optional) Specifies the base DN for the location of groups
                   data. By default, it is same as the base-dn, but it can be
                   tuned, if necessary.

               group-search-filter
                   (Optional) Specifies the search filter to find group
                   memberships for the user. The default is uniquemember=%d
                   (%d expands to the user elementDN).

               group-target
                   (Optional) Specifies the LDAP attribute name that contains
                   group name entries. The default is CN.

               search-bind-dn
                   (Optional) Specifies an optional DN used to authenticate to
                   the directory for performing the search-filter lookup. Only
                   required for directories that do not allow anonymous
                   search.

               search-bind-password
                   (Optional) Specifies the LDAP password for the DN given in
                   search-bind-dn.

OPERANDS
       auth_realm_name
           A short name for the realm. This name is used to refer to the realm
           from, for example, web.xml.
