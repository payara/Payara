create-jacc-provider(1)   asadmin Utility Subcommands  create-jacc-provider(1)

NAME
       create-jacc-provider - enables administrators to create a JACC provider
       that can be used by third-party authorization modules for applications
       running in GlassFish Server

SYNOPSIS
           create-jacc-provider [--help]
           [--policyproviderclass pol-provider-class]
           [--policyconfigfactoryclass pc-factory-class]
           [--property name=value)[:name=value]*]
           [--target target] jacc-provider-name

DESCRIPTION
       The create-jacc-provider subcommand creates a JSR-115—compliant Java
       Authorization Contract for Containers (JACC) provider that can be used
       for authorization of applications running in GlassFish Server. The JACC
       provider is created as a jacc-provider element within the
       security-service element in the domain's domain.xml file.

       The default GlassFish Server installation includes two JACC providers,
       named default and simple. Any JACC providers created with the
       create-jacc-provider subcommand are in addition to these two default
       providers. The default GlassFish Server JACC providers implement a
       simple, file-based authorization engine that complies with the JACC
       specification. The create-jacc-provider subcommand makes it possible to
       specify additional third-party JACC providers.

       You can create any number of JACC providers within the security-service
       element, but the GlassFish Server runtime uses only one of them at any
       given time. The jacc-provider element in the security-service element
       points to the name of the provider that is currently in use by
       GlassFish Server. If you change this element to point to a different
       JACC provider, restart GlassFish Server.

       This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       If an option has a short option name, then the short option precedes
       the long option name. Short options have one dash whereas long options
       have two dashes.

       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --policyproviderclass
           Specifies the fully qualified class name for the
           jakarta.security.jacc.policy.provider that implements the
           java.security.Policy.

       --policyconfigfactoryclass
           Specifies the fully qualified class name for the
           jakarta.security.jacc.PolicyConfigurationFactory.provider that
           implements the provider-specific
           jakarta.security.jacc.PolicyConfigurationFactory.

       --property
           Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the JACC
           provider. The following properties are available:

           repository
               The directory containing the JACC policy file. For the default
               GlassFish Server JACC provider, the default directory is
               ${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/generated/policy. This property is
               not defined by default for the simple GlassFish Server JACC
               provider.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which you are creating the JACC provider.
           The following values are valid:

           server
               Creates the JACC provider on the default server instance. This
               is the default value.

           configuration_name
               Creates the JACC provider in the specified configuration.

           instance_name
               Creates the JACC provider on a specified server instance.

OPERANDS
       jacc-provider-name
           The name of the provider used to reference the jacc-provider
           element in domain.xml.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating a JACC Provider
           The following example shows how to create a JACC provider named
           testJACC on the default server target.

               --policyproviderclass org.glassfish.exousia.modules.def.DefaultPolicy
               --policyconfigfactoryclass org.glassfish.exousia.modules.def.DefaultPolicyConfigurationFactory
               testJACC
