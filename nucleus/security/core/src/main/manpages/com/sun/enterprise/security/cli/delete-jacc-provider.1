delete-jacc-provider(1)   asadmin Utility Subcommands  delete-jacc-provider(1)

NAME
       delete-jacc-provider - enables administrators to delete JACC providers
       defined for a domain

SYNOPSIS
           delete-jacc-provider [--help]
           [--target target] jacc-provider-name

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-jacc-provider subcommand enables administrators to delete
       JACC providers defined for a domain. JACC providers are defined as
       jacc-provider elements in the security-service element in the domain's
       domain.xml file. JACC providers can be created using the GlassFish
       Server Admin Console or the create-jacc-provider subcommand.

       The default GlassFish Server installation includes two JACC providers,
       named default and simple. These default providers should not be
       deleted.

       The JACC provider used byGlassFish Server for authorization is
       identified by the jacc-provider element of security-service in
       domain.xml. Therefore, if you delete the jacc-provider provider, make
       sure you change jacc-provider to the name of some other JACC provider
       that exists under security-service.

       If you change the jacc-provider element to point to a different JACC
       provider, you must restart GlassFish Server.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
