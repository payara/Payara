NAME
       create-password-alias - creates a password alias

SYNOPSIS
           create-password-alias [--help]
           aliasname

DESCRIPTION
       The create-password-alias subcommand creates an alias for a password.
       An alias is a token of the form ${ALIAS=aliasname}. The password that
       corresponds to the alias name is stored in an encrypted form.

       The create-password-alias subcommand can be run interactively or
       noninteractively.

       *   When run interactively, the subcommand prompts the user for the
           alias password and to confirm the alias password.

       *   When run noninteractively, the subcommand reads the alias password
           from a file that is passed through the --passwordfile option of the
           asadmin(1M) utility. The file must contain an entry of the form
           AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD=alias-password, where alias-password is the
           alias password. The noninteractive form of this command is suitable
           for use in scripts.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
