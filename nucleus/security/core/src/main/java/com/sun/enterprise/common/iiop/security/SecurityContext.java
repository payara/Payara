/**
 * A subject is used a container for passing the security context information in the service context
 * field. The security context information in the subject must be stored either as a private or a
 * public credential according to the following convention:
 *
 * PasswordCredential: Client authentication will be performed using the username and password in
 * the PasswordCredential. PasswordCredential must be passed as a PrivateCredential.
 *
 * X500Name: DN name specified in X500Name will be asserted. X500Name must be passed as a
 * PublicCredential.
 *
 * GSSUPName: Identity specified in GSSUPName will be asserted. GSSUPName must be passed as a
 * PublicCredential.
 *
 * X509CertificateCredential: The certificate chain in the credential will be asserted. The
 * credential must be passed as a PublicCredential.
 *
 * AnonCredential: Anonymous identity will be asserted. Credential must be passed as a
 * PublicCredential.
 *
 * Class fields in the SecurityContext are used for credential selection. There are two class
 * fields: authcls and identcls.
 *
 * authcls is a Class object that identifies the credential for client authentication.
 *
 * identcls is a Class object that identifies the credential for identity assertion.
 *
 * The following semantics must be observed:
 *
 * 1. A client authentication token is always passed as a private credential. authcls set to the
 * class of the authentication token
 *
 * 2. An identity token is always passed as a public credential. identcls is set to the class of the
 * identity token.
 *
 * 3. authcls is set to null if there is no client auth token
 *
 * 4. identcls is set to null if there is no ident token
 *
 * 5. There must not be more than one instance of class identified by authcls or identcls. However,
 * there can be one instance of identcls *and* authcls (this allows both a client auth token and an
 * identity token to be passed across the interface).
