/**
 *
 * Starting in GlassFish 3.1.2, the DAS uses SSL to send admin requests to
 * instances regardless of whether the user has enabled secure admin.  For this to
 * work correctly when upgrading from earlier 3.x releases, there are some changes 
 * to the configuration that must be in place.  This start-up service makes
 * sure that the config is correct as quickly as possible to avoid degrading
 * start-up performance. (Upgrades from 2.x are handled by the SecureAdminConfigUpgrade
 * upgrade service.)
 * <p>
 * For 3.1.2 and later the configuration needs to include:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * <secure-admin special-admin-indicator="xxx">
 *   at least one <secure-admin-principal> element; if none, supply these defaults:
 * 
 *   <secure-admin-principal dn="dn-for-DAS"/>
 *   <secure-admin-principal dn="dn-for-instances"/>
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Further, the sec-admin-listener set-up needs to be added (if not already there)
 * for the non-DAS configurations.  Note that the work to configure the
 * listeners and related protocols are already implemented by SecureAdminCommand,
 * so this class delegates much of its work to that logic.
