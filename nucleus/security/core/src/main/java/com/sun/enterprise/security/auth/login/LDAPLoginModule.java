/**
 * iAS JAAS LoginModule for an LDAP Realm.
 *
 * <P>Refer to the LDAPRealm documentation for necessary and optional
 * configuration parameters for the iAS LDAP login support.
 *
 * <P>There are various ways in which a user can be authenticated using
 * an LDAP directory. Currently this login module only supports one mode,
 * 'find and bind'. Other modes may be added as schedules permit.
 *
 * <P>Mode: <i>find-bind</i>
 * <ol>
 *  <li>An LDAP search is issued on the directory starting at base-dn
 *      with the given search-filter (having substituted the user name
 *      in place of %s). If no entries match this search, login fails
 *      and authentication is over.
 *  <li>The DN of the entry which matched the search as the DN
 *      of the user in the directory. If the search-filter
 *      is properly set there should always be a single match; if there are
 *      multiple matches, the first one found is used.
 *  <li>Next an LDAP bind is attempted using the above DN and the provided
 *      password. If this fails, login is considered to have failed and
 *      authentication is over.
 *  <li>Then an LDAP search is issued on the directory starting at
 *      group-base-dn with the given group-search-filter (having
 *      substituted %d for the user DN previously found). From the
 *      matched entry(ies) all the values of group-target are taken
 *      as group names in which the user has membership. If no entries
 *      are found, the group membership is empty.
 * </ol>
