# Although the lines in this file are formatted as environment
# variable assignments, this file is NOT typically invoked as a script 
# from another script to define these variables.  Rather, this file is read 
# and processed by a server as it starts up.  That scanning code resolves 
# the relative paths against the Payara installation directory.
#
# Yet, this file is also where users of earlier versions have sometimes added 
# a definition of AS_JAVA to control which version of Java Payara should use.
# As a result, in order to run a user-specified version of Java, the asadmin 
# and appclient scripts do indeed invoke this file as a script - but ONLY to
# define AS_JAVA.  Any calling script should not rely on the other settings 
# because the relative paths will be resolved against the current directory 
# when the calling script is run, not the installation directory of Payara, 
# and such resolution will not work correctly unless the script happens to be 
# run from the Payara installation directory.
# 
# In cases where user variables need to be set, however, any set in this file 
# will be picked up. Any path must be absolute if the variable is expected to
# be used other than by a full Payara installation which expects the directory
# structure to be as configured by default below.
