/**
 * Manages retrying of autodeployed files in case a file is copied slowly.
 * <p>
 * If a file is copied into the autodeploy directory slowly, it can appear there
 * before the copy operation has finished, causing the attempt to autodeploy it to fail.
 * This class encapsulates logic to decide whether to retry the deployment of
 * such files on successive loops through
 * the autodeployer thread, reporting failure only if the candidate file has
 * failed to deploy earlier and has remained stable in size for a 
 * (configurable) period of time.  
 * <p>
 * The main public entry point are the {@link ï¿½} method and
 * the {@link reportSuccessfulDeployment}, 
 * {@link reportFailedDeployment}, {@link reportSuccessfulUndeployment}, and
 * {@link reportUnsuccessfulUndeployment} methods.  
 * <p>
 * The client should invoke {@link shouldAttemptDeployment} when it has identified
 * a candidate file for deployment but before trying to deploy that file.  This
 * retry manager will return whether the caller should attempt to deploy the file,
 * at least based on whether there has been a previous unsuccessful attempt to
 * deploy it and, if so, whether the file seems to be stable in size or not.  
 * <p>
 * When the caller actually tries to deploy a file, it must invoke 
 * {@link reportSuccessfulDeployment} or {@link reportFailedDeployment) 
 * so that the retry manager keeps its information about the file up-to-date.
 * Similarly, when the caller tries to undeploy a file it must invoke
 * {@link reportSuccessfulUndeployment} or {@link reportFailedUndeployment}.
 * <P>
 * Internally for each file that has failed to deploy the retry manager records
 * the file's size and the timestamp of the most recent failure and the timestamp at 
 * which that file will be assumed to be fully copied.  At that time the file's
 * retry period will expire.  This retry expiration value is extended each time 
 * the file changes size since the last time it was checked.
 * <p>
 * If AutoDeployer previously reported failures to deploy the file and the 
 * file's size has been stable for its retry expiration time, then the 
 * {@link shouldAttemptDeployment} method returns true to trigger another attempt to
 * deploy the file.  If the autodeployer reports another failed deployment
 * then the retry manager concludes that the file is not simply a slow-copying 
 * file but is truly invalid.  In that case 
 * it throws an exception.  
 * <p>
 * Once the caller reports a successful deployment of a file by invoking
 * {@link reportSuccessfulDeployment} the retry manager discards any record of 
 * that file from its internal data structures.  Similarly the retry manager
 * stops monitoring a file once the autodeployer has made an attempt - 
 * successful or unsuccessful - to undeploy it.
 * <p>
 * An important change from v2 to v3 is the change in the default retry limit.
 * In v2 we could try to open a file as a ZIP file to help decide if it had
 * finished copying, but in v3 we cannot make assumptions about how apps
 * will be packaged (some may be ZIPs, but others may be single files).  We
 * need to provide a balance between prompt reporting of a failed auto-deployment
 * vs. handling the case of a slow copy operation which, for a while, manifests
 * itself as a failed deployment.
