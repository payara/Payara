NAME
       add-library - adds one or more library JAR files to GlassFish Server

SYNOPSIS
           add-library [--help] [--type={common|ext|app|war}] [--upload={false|true}]

           library-file-path [library-file-path ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The add-library subcommand adds one or more library archive files to
       GlassFish Server.

       The --type option specifies the library type and the GlassFish Server
       directory to which the library is added.

       The library-file-path operand is the path to the JAR file that contains
       the library to be added. To specify multiple libraries, specify
       multiple paths separated by spaces.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           The library archive file is  |
           |           added to the DAS. For common |
           |           and extension libraries, you |
           |           must restart the DAS so the  |
           |           libraries are picked up by   |
           |           the server runtime. To add   |
           |           the libraries to other       |
           |           server instances,            |
           |           synchronize the instances    |
           |           with the DAS by restarting   |
           |           them.                        |
           +----------------------------------------+

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --type
           Specifies the library type and the GlassFish Server directory to
           which the library is added. Valid values are as follows:

           common
               Adds the library files to the Common class loader directory,
               domain-dir/lib. This is the default.

           ext
               Adds the library files to the Java optional package directory,
               domain-dir/lib/ext.

           app
               Adds the library files to the application-specific class loader
               directory, domain-dir/lib/applibs.

           war
               Adds the library files to the war-packaged class loader directory,
               domain-dir/lib/warlibs.

           For more information about these directories, see "Class Loaders"
           in Oracle GlassFish Server Application Development Guide.

       --upload
           Specifies whether the subcommand uploads the file to the DAS. In
           most situations, this option can be omitted.

           Valid values are as follows:

           false
               The subcommand does not upload the file and attempts to access
               the file through the specified file name. If the DAS cannot
               access the file, the subcommand fails.

               For example, the DAS might be running as a different user than
               the administration user and does not have read access to the
               file. In this situation, the subcommand fails if the --upload
               option is false.

           true
               The subcommand uploads the file to the DAS over the network
               connection.

           The default value depends on whether the DAS is on the host where
           the subcommand is run or is on a remote host.

           *   If the DAS is on the host where the subcommand is run, the
               default is false.

           *   If the DAS is on a remote host, the default is true.

           If a directory filepath is specified, this option is ignored.

OPERANDS
       library-file-path
           The paths to the archive files that contain the libraries that are
           to be added. You can specify an absolute path or a relative path.

           If the --upload option is set to true, this is the path to the file
           on the local client machine. If the --upload option is set to
           false, this is the path to the file on the server machine.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Adding Libraries
           This example adds the library in the archive file mylib.jar to the
           application-specific class loader directory on the default server
           instance.

               asadmin> add-library --type app /tmp/mylib.jar
               Command add-library executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           subcommand executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the subcommand
