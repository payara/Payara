undeploy(1)               asadmin Utility Subcommands              undeploy(1)

NAME
       undeploy - removes a deployed component

SYNOPSIS
           undeploy [--help] [--target target] [--droptables={true|false}]
           [--cascade={false|true}] name

DESCRIPTION
       The undeploy subcommand uninstalls a deployed application or module and
       removes it from the repository.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --cascade
           If set to true, deletes all the connection pools and connector
           resources associated with the resource adapter being undeployed. If
           set to false, the undeploy fails if any pools and resources are
           still associated with the resource adapter. Then, either those
           pools and resources must be deleted explicitly, or the option must
           be set to true. If the option is set to false, and if there are no
           pools and resources still associated with the resource adapter, the
           resource adapter is undeployed. This option is applicable to
           connectors (resource adapters) and applications. Default value is
           false.

       --droptables
           If set to true, drops the tables that the application created by
           using CMP beans during deployment. If set to false, tables are not
           dropped. If not specified, the value of the drop-tables-at-deploy
           entry in the cmp-resource element of the glassfish-ejb-jar.xml file
           determines whether or not tables are dropped. Default value is
           true.

       --target
           Specifies the target from which you are undeploying. Valid values
           are:

           server
               Undeploys the component from the default server instance server
               and is the default value.

           domain
               Undeploys the component from the domain.

           cluster_name
               Undeploys the component from every server instance in the
               cluster.

           instance_name
               Undeploys the component from a particular stand-alone server
               instance.

OPERANDS
       name
           Name of the deployed component.

           The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows
           the name and is separated from the name by a colon (:). The version
           identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain
           alphanumeric characters plus underscore (_), dash (-), and period
           (.) characters. To delete multiple versions, you can use an
           asterisk (*) as a wildcard character. For more information about
           module and application versions, see "Module and Application
           Versions" in Oracle GlassFish Server Application Deployment Guide.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Undeploying an Enterprise Application
           This example undeploys an enterprise application named Cart.ear.

               asadmin> undeploy Cart
               Command undeploy executed successfully.

       Example 2, Undeploying an Enterprise Bean With Container-Managed
       Persistence (CMP)
           This example undeploys a CMP bean named myejb and drops the
           corresponding database tables.

               asadmin> undeploy --droptables=true myejb
               Command undeploy executed successfully.

       Example 3, Undeploying a Connector (Resource Adapter)
           This example undeploys the connector module named jdbcra and
           performs a cascading delete to remove the associated resources and
           connection pools.
