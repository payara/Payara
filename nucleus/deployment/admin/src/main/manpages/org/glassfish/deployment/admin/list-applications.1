list-applications(1)      asadmin Utility Subcommands     list-applications(1)

NAME
       list-applications - lists deployed applications

SYNOPSIS
           list-applications [--help]
           [--long={false|true}] [--resources] [--subcomponents]
           [--type type] [target]

DESCRIPTION
       The list-applications subcommand lists deployed Java EE applications
       and the type of each application that is listed.

       If the --type option is not specified, all applications are listed. If
       the type option is specified, you must specify a type. The possible
       types are listed in the Options section of this help page.

       If multiple versions of a module or application are deployed, this
       subcommand lists all versions. To list which version is enabled, set
       the --long option to true. For more information about module and
       application versions, see "Module and Application Versions" in Oracle
       GlassFish Server Application Deployment Guide.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --long
           If true, displays whether each module or application listed is
           enabled. The default is false.

       --resources
           Lists the application-scoped resources for each application. If the
           --subcomponents option is also used, lists the application-scoped
           resources for each component within the application.

       --subcomponents
           Lists the subcomponents of each application. The subcomponents
           listed depend on the application type. For example, for a Java EE
           application (EAR file), modules are listed. For a web application,
           servlets and JSP pages are listed. For an EJB module, EJB
           subcomponents are listed.

       --type
           Specifies the type of the applications that are to be listed. The
           options are as follows:

           *   application

           *   appclient

           *   connector

           *   ejb

           *   web

           *   webservice

           If no type is specified, all applications are listed.

OPERANDS
       --target
           This is the name of the target upon which the subcommand operates.
           The valid values are as follows:

           server
               Lists the applications for the default server instance server
               and is the default value.

           domain
               Lists the applications for the domain.

           instance_name
               Lists the applications for a particular stand-alone server
               instance.
