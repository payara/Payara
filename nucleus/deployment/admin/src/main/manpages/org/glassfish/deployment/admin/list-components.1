NAME
       list-components - lists deployed components

SYNOPSIS
           list-components [--help]

           [--type type] [target]

DESCRIPTION
           Note
           +-------------------------------------+
           |           The list-components       |
           |           subcommand is deprecated. |
           |           Use the list-applications |
           |           subcommand instead.       |
           +-------------------------------------+

       The list-components subcommand lists all deployed Java EE components.

       If the --type option is not specified, all components are listed. If
       the type option is specified, you must specify a type. The possible
       types are listed in the Options section in this help page.

       If multiple versions of a module or application are deployed, this
       subcommand lists all versions. To list which version is enabled, set
       the --long option to true. For more information about module and
       application versions, see "Module and Application Versions" in Oracle
       GlassFish Server Application Deployment Guide.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --long
           If true, displays whether each module or application listed is
           enabled. The default is false.

       --resources
           Lists the application-scoped resources for each component. If the
           --subcomponents option is also used, lists the application-scoped
           resources for each component within an application.

       --subcomponents
           Lists the subcomponents of each component. The subcomponents listed
           depend on the component type. For example, for a Java EE
           application (EAR file), modules are listed. For a web application,
           servlets and JSP pages are listed. For an EJB module, EJB
           subcomponents are listed.

       --type
           Specifies the type of the components that are to be listed. The
           options are as follows:

           *   application

           *   appclient

           *   connector

           *   ejb

           *   web

           *   webservice

           If no type is specified, all components are listed.

OPERANDS
       target
           This is the name of the target upon which the subcommand operates.
           The valid values are:

           server
               Lists the components for the default server instance server and
               is the default value.

           domain
               Lists the components for the domain.

           cluster_name
               Lists the components for the cluster.

           instance_name
               Lists the components for a particular stand-alone server
               instance.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Listing Components
           This example lists the connector components. (cciblackbox-tx.rar
           was deployed.)

               asadmin> list-components --type connector
               cciblackbox-tx <connector>
