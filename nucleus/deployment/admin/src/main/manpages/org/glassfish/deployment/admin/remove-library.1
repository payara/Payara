remove-library(1)         asadmin Utility Subcommands        remove-library(1)

NAME
       remove-library - removes one or more library JAR files from GlassFish
       Server

SYNOPSIS
           remove-library [--help] [--type={common|ext|app}]

           library-name [library-name ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The remove-library subcommand removes one or more library JAR files
       from GlassFish Server.

       The --type option specifies the library type and the GlassFish Server
       directory from which the library is removed.

       The library-name operand is the name of the JAR file that contains the
       library to be removed. To specify multiple libraries, specify multiple
       names separated by spaces.

           Note
           +---------------------------------------+
           |           The library archive file is |
           |           removed from the DAS. For   |
           |           common and extension        |
           |           libraries, you must restart |
           |           the DAS so the library      |
           |           removals are picked up by   |
           |           the server runtime. To      |
           |           remove the libraries from   |
           |           other server instances,     |
           |           synchronize the instances   |
           |           with the DAS by restarting  |
           |           them.                       |
           |           This command is not         |
           |           supported on the Windows    |
           |           operating system.           |
           +---------------------------------------+

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --type
           Specifies the library type and the GlassFish Server directory from
           which the library is removed. Valid values are as follows:

           common
               Removes the library files from the Common class loader
               directory, domain-dir/lib. This is the default.

           ext
               Removes the library files from the Java optional package
               directory, domain-dir/lib/ext.

           app
               Removes the library files from the application-specific class
               loader directory, domain-dir/lib/applibs.

           For more information about these directories, see "Class Loaders"
           in Oracle GlassFish Server Application Development Guide.

OPERANDS
       library-name
           The names of the JAR files that contain the libraries that are to
           be removed.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Removing Libraries
           This example removes the library in the archive file mylib.jar from
           the application-specific class loader directory on the default
           server instance.
