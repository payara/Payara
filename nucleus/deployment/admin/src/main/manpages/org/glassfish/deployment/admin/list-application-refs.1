list-application-refs(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands  list-application-refs(1)

NAME
       list-application-refs - lists the existing application references

SYNOPSIS
           list-application-refs [--help] [--long={false|true}] [target]

DESCRIPTION
       The list-application-refs subcommand lists all application references
       in a cluster or an unclustered server instance. This effectively lists
       all the modules deployed on the specified target (for example, J2EE
       applications, Web modules, and enterprise bean modules).

       If multiple versions of a module or application are deployed, this
       subcommand lists all versions. To list which version is enabled, set
       the --long option to true. For more information about module and
       application versions, see "Module and Application Versions" in Oracle
       GlassFish Server Application Deployment Guide.

       The target instance or instances making up the cluster need not be
       running or available for this subcommand to succeed.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --long
           If true, displays whether each module or application listed is
           enabled. The default is false.
