delete-application-ref(1) asadmin Utility Subcommands  delete-application-ref(1)

NAME
       delete-application-ref - removes a reference to an application

SYNOPSIS
           delete-application-ref [--help] [--target target]
            [--cascade=false] reference_name

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-application-ref subcommand removes a reference from a
       cluster or an unclustered server instance to an application. This
       effectively results in the application element being undeployed and no
       longer available on the targeted instance or cluster.

       The target instance or instances making up the cluster need not be
       running or available for this subcommand to succeed. If one or more
       instances are not available, they will no longer load the application
       the next time they start.

       Removal of the reference does not result in removal of the application
       from the domain. The bits are removed only by the undeploy subcommand.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target from which you are removing the application
           reference. Valid values are

           *   server- Specifies the default server instance as the target.
               server is the name of the default server instance and is the
               default value.

           *   cluster_name- Specifies a certain cluster as the target.

           *   instance_name- Specifies a certain stand-alone server instance
               as the target.

       --cascade
           For a connector module, indicates whether the resources dependent
           on the module should also be recursively deleted. The default is
           false. The connector module can be either a stand-alone RAR file or
           a module within an EAR file.

OPERANDS
       reference_name
           The name of the application or module, which can be a Java EE
           application module, Web module, EJB module, connector module or
           application client module.

           The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows
           the name and is separated from the name by a colon (:). The version
           identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain
           alphanumeric characters plus underscore (_), dash (-), and period
           (.) characters. To delete references to multiple versions, you can
           use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard character. For more information
           about module and application versions, see "Module and Application
           Versions" in Oracle GlassFish Server Application Deployment Guide.
