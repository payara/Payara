OPERANDS
       component-name
           The name of the component whose status is to be listed.

           The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows
           the name and is separated from the name by a colon (:). The version
           identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain
           alphanumeric characters plus underscore (_), dash (-), and period
           (.) characters. To list multiple versions, you can use an asterisk
           (*) as a wildcard character. For more information about module and
           application versions, see "Module and Application Versions" in
