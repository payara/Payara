NAME
       disable - disables the component

SYNOPSIS
           disable [--help] [--target target_name] component_name

DESCRIPTION
       The disable subcommand immediately disables the specified deployed
       component. If the component has not been deployed, an error message is
       returned.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           This option specifies the target on which you are disabling the
           component. Valid values are:

           server
               Disables the component on the default server instance server
               and is the default value.

           domain_name
               Disables the component on the named domain.

           cluster_name
               Disables the component on every server instance in the cluster.

           instance_name
               Disables the component on a particular clustered or stand-alone
               server instance.

OPERANDS
       component_name
           name of the component to be disabled.

           The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows
           the name and is separated from the name by a colon (:). The version
           identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain
           alphanumeric characters plus underscore (_), dash (-), and period
           (.) characters. To disable multiple versions, you can use an
           asterisk (*) as a wildcard character. For more information about
           module and application versions, see "Module and Application
           Versions" in Oracle GlassFish Server Application Deployment Guide.
