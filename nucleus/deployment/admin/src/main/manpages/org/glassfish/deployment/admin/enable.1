enable(1)                 asadmin Utility Subcommands                enable(1)

NAME
       enable - enables the component

SYNOPSIS
           enable [--help] [--target target_name] component_name

DESCRIPTION
       The enable subcommand enables the specified deployed component. If the
       component is already enabled, then it is re-enabled. If it has not been
       deployed, then an error message is returned.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           This option specifies the target on which you are enabling the
           component. Valid values are:

           server
               Enables the default server instance server and is the default
               value.

           domain_name
               Enables the named domain.

           cluster_name
               Enables every server instance in the cluster.

           instance_name
               Enables a particular clustered or stand-alone server instance.

OPERANDS
       component_name
           name of the component to be enabled.

           The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows
           the name and is separated from the name by a colon (:). The version
           identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain
           alphanumeric characters plus underscore (_), dash (-), and period
           (.) characters. For more information about module and application
           versions, see "Module and Application Versions" in Oracle GlassFish
           Server Application Deployment Guide.

           At most one version of a module or application can be enabled on a
           server instance. All other versions are disabled. Enabling one
           version automatically disables all others.
