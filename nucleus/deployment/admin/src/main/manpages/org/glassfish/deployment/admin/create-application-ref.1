create-application-ref(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands  create-application-ref(1)

NAME
       create-application-ref - creates a reference to an application

SYNOPSIS
           create-application-ref [--help] [--target target]
           [--virtualservers virtual_servers] [--enabled=true]
           [--lbenabled=true] reference_name

DESCRIPTION
       The create-application-ref subcommand creates a reference from a
       deployment group or an unclustered server instance to a previously deployed
       application element (for example, a Java EE application, a Web module,
       or an enterprise bean module). This effectively results in the
       application element being deployed and made available on the targeted
       instance or deployment group.

       The target instance or instances making up the cluster need not be
       running or available for this subcommand to succeed. If one or more
       instances are not available, they will receive the new application
       element the next time they start.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which you are creating the application
           reference. Valid values are

           *   server- Specifies the default server instance as the target for
               creating the application reference.  server is the name of the
               default server instance and is the default value for this
               option.

           *   deployment_group- Specifies a particular deployment group as the
               target for creating the application reference.

           *   instance_name- Specifies a particular stand-alone server
               instance as the target for creating the application reference.

       --virtualservers
           Specifies a comma-separated list of virtual server IDs on which to
           deploy. This option applies only to Web modules (either standalone
           or in a Java EE application). If this option is not specified, the
           application is deployed to all virtual servers except the
           administrative server, __asadmin.

       --enabled
           Indicates whether the application should be enabled (that is,
           loaded). This value will take effect only if the application is
           enabled at the global level. The default is true.

       --lbenabled
           Controls whether the deployed application is available for load
           balancing. The default is true.

OPERANDS
       reference_name
           The name of the application or module, which can be a Java EE
           application, Web module, EJB module, connector module or application
           client module.

           The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows
           the name and is separated from the name by a colon (:). The version
           identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain
           alphanumeric characters plus underscore (_), dash (-), and period
           (.) characters. If the --enabled option is set to false, you can
           create references to multiple disabled versions by using an
           asterisk (*) as a wildcard character. For more information about
           module and application versions, see "Module and Application
           Versions" in Oracle GlassFish Server Application Deployment Guide.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating an Application Reference
           The following example creates a reference to the Web module
           MyWebApp on the unclustered server instance NewServer.

               asadmin> create-application-ref --target NewServer MyWebApp
               Command create-application-ref executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
