DESCRIPTION
       The redeploy subcommand redeploys an enterprise application, web
       application, module based on the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)
       specification (EJB module), connector module, or application client
       module that is already deployed or already exists. The redeploy
       subcommand preserves the settings and other options with which the
       application was originally deployed. The application must already be
       deployed. Otherwise, an error occurs.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --virtualservers
           One or more virtual server IDs. Multiple IDs are separated by
           commas.

       --contextroot
           Valid only if the archive is a web module. It is ignored for other
           archive types; it will be the value specified by default-context-path
           in web.xml, if specified; defaults to filename without extension.

       --precompilejsp
           By default this option does not allow the JSP to be precompiled
           during deployment. Instead, JSPs are compiled during runtime.
           Default is false.

       --verify
           If set to true and the required verifier packages are installed
           from the Update Tool, the syntax and semantics of the deployment
           descriptor is verified. Default is false.

       --name
           Name of the deployable component.

           The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows
           the name and is separated from the name by a colon (:). The version
           identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain
           alphanumeric characters plus underscore (_), dash (-), and period
           (.) characters. For more information about module and application
           versions, see "Module and Application Versions" in Oracle GlassFish
           Server Application Deployment Guide.

       --upload
           Specifies whether the subcommand uploads the file to the DAS. In
           most situations, this option can be omitted.

           Valid values are as follows:

           false
               The subcommand does not upload the file and attempts to access
               the file through the specified file name. If the DAS cannot
               access the file, the subcommand fails.

               For example, the DAS might be running as a different user than
               the administration user and does not have read access to the
               file. In this situation, the subcommand fails if the --upload
               option is false.

           true
               The subcommand uploads the file to the DAS over the network
               connection.

           The default value depends on whether the DAS is on the host where
           the subcommand is run or is on a remote host.

           *   If the DAS is on the host where the subcommand is run, the
               default is false.

           *   If the DAS is on a remote host, the default is true.

           If a directory filepath is specified, this option is ignored.

       --retrieve
           Retrieves the client stub JAR file from the server machine to the
           local directory.

       --dbvendorname
           Specifies the name of the database vendor for which tables are
           created. Supported values include db2, mssql, oracle, h2,
           postgresql, and sybase, case-insensitive. If not specified,
           the value of the database-vendor-name attribute in
           glassfish-ejb-jar.xml is used. If no value is specified, a
           connection is made to the resource specified by the jndi-name
           subelement of the cmp-resource element in the glassfish-ejb-jar.xml
           file, and the database vendor name is read. If the connection
           cannot be established, or if the value is not recognized, SQL-92
           compliance is presumed.

       --createtables
           If specified as true, creates tables at deployment of an
           application with unmapped CMP beans. If specified as false, tables
           are not created. If not specified, the value of the
           create-tables-at-deploy entry in the cmp-resource element of the
           glassfish-ejb-jar.xml file determines whether or not tables are
           created. No unique constraints are created for the tables.

       --dropandcreatetables
           If specified as true when the component is redeployed, the tables
           created by the previous deployment are dropped before creating the
           new tables. Applies to deployed applications with unmapped CMP
           beans. If specified as false, tables are neither dropped nor
           created. If not specified, the tables are dropped if the
           drop-tables-at-undeploy entry in the cmp-resource element of the
           glassfish-ejb-jar.xml file is set to true, and the new tables are
           created if the create-tables-at-deploy entry in the cmp-resource
           element of the glassfish-ejb-jar.xml file is set to true.

       --uniquetablenames
           Guarantees unique table names for all the beans and results in a
           hash code added to the table names. This is useful if you have an
           application with case-sensitive bean names. Applies to applications
           with unmapped CMP beans.

       --deploymentplan
           Deploys the deployment plan, which is a JAR file that contains
           GlassFish Server descriptors. Specify this option when deploying a
           pure EAR file. A pure EAR file is an EAR without GlassFish Server
           descriptors.

       --altdd
           Deploys the application using a Java EE standard deployment
           descriptor that resides outside of the application archive. Specify
           an absolute path or a relative path to the alternate deployment
           descriptor file. The alternate deployment descriptor overrides the
           top-level deployment descriptor packaged in the archive. For
           example, for an EAR, the --altdd option overrides application.xml.
           For a standalone module, the --altdd option overrides the top-level
           module descriptor such as web.xml.

       --runtimealtdd
           Deploys the application using a GlassFish Server runtime deployment
           descriptor that resides outside of the application archive. Specify
           an absolute path or a relative path to the alternate deployment
           descriptor file. The alternate deployment descriptor overrides the
           top-level deployment descriptor packaged in the archive. For
           example, for an EAR, the --runtimealtdd option overrides
           glassfish-application.xml. For a standalone module, the
           --runtimealtdd option overrides the top-level module descriptor
           such as glassfish-web.xml. Applies to GlassFish Server deployment
           descriptors only (glassfish-*.xml); the name of the alternate
           deployment descriptor file must begin with glassfish-. Does not
           apply to sun-*.xml deployment descriptors, which are deprecated.

       --deploymentorder
           Specifies the deployment order of the application. This is useful
           if the application has dependencies and must be loaded in a certain
           order at server startup. The deployment order is specified as an
           integer. The default value is 100. Applications with lower numbers
           are loaded before applications with higher numbers. For example, an
           application with a deployment order of 102 is loaded before an
           application with a deployment order of 110. If a deployment order
           is not specified, the default value of 100 is assigned. If two
           applications have the same deployment order, the first application
           to be deployed is the first application to be loaded at server
           startup.

           The deployment order is typically specified when the application is
           first deployed but can also be specified or changed after initial
           deployment using the set subcommand. You can view the deployment
           order of an application using the get subcommand.

       --enabled
           Allows users to access the application. If set to false, users will
           not be able to access the application. This option enables the
           application on the specified target instance or cluster. If you
           deploy to the target domain, this option is ignored, since
           deploying to the domain doesn't deploy to a specific instance or
           cluster. The default is true.

       --generatermistubs
           If set to true, static RMI-IIOP stubs are generated and put into
           the client.jar. If set to false, the stubs are not generated.
           Default is false.

       --availabilityenabled
           This option controls whether high-availability is enabled for web
           sessions and for stateful session bean (SFSB) checkpointing and
           potentially passivation. If set to false (default) all web session
           saving and SFSB checkpointing is disabled for the specified
           application, web application, or EJB module. If set to true, the
           specified application or module is enabled for high-availability.
           Set this option to true only if high availability is configured and
           enabled at higher levels, such as the server and container levels.

       --asyncreplication
           This option controls whether web session and SFSB states for which
           high availability is enabled are first buffered and then replicated
           using a separate asynchronous thread. If set to true (default),
           performance is improved but availability is reduced. If the
           instance where states are buffered but not yet replicated fails,
           the states are lost. If set to false, performance is reduced but
           availability is guaranteed. States are not buffered but immediately
           transmitted to other instances in the cluster.

       --lbenabled
           This option controls whether the deployed application is available
           for load balancing. The default is true.

       --keepstate
           This option controls whether web sessions, SFSB instances, and
           persistently created EJB timers are retained between redeployments.

           The default is false. This option is supported only on the default
           server instance, named server. It is not supported and ignored for
           any other target.

           Some changes to an application between redeployments prevent this
           feature from working properly. For example, do not change the set
           of instance variables in the SFSB bean class.

           For web applications, this feature is applicable only if in the
           glassfish-web-app.xml file the persistence-type attribute of the
           session-manager element is file.

           For stateful session bean instances, the persistence type without
           high availability is set in the server (the sfsb-persistence-type
           attribute) and must be set to file, which is the default and
           recommended value.

           If any active web session, SFSB instance, or EJB timer fails to be
           preserved or restored, none of these will be available when the
           redeployment is complete. However, the redeployment continues and a
           warning is logged.

           To preserve active state data, GlassFish Server serializes the data
           and saves it in memory. To restore the data, the class loader of
           the newly redeployed application deserializes the data that was
           previously saved.

       --warlibs
           If set to true, enables an application to make use of shared
           libraries installed to `domain_dir/lib/warlibs`.
           Default is false.
           This parameter takes precedence over enabling warlibs in --properties.

       --libraries
           A comma-separated list of library JAR files. Specify the library
           JAR files by their relative or absolute paths. Specify relative
           paths relative to domain-dir/lib/applibs. The libraries are made
           available to the application in the order specified.

       --target
           Specifies the target to which you are deploying. Valid values are:

           server
               Deploys the component to the default server instance server and
               is the default value.

           domain
               Deploys the component to the domain. If domain is the target
               for an initial deployment, the application is deployed to the
               domain, but no server instances or clusters reference the
               application. If domain is the target for a redeployment, and
               dynamic reconfiguration is enabled for the clusters or server
               instances that reference the application, the referencing
               clusters or server instances automatically get the new version
               of the application. If redeploying, and dynamic configuration
               is disabled, the referencing clusters or server instances do
               not get the new version of the application until the clustered
               or standalone server instances are restarted.

           cluster_name
               Deploys the component to every server instance in the cluster.

           instance_name
               Deploys the component to a particular stand-alone server
               instance.

       --type
           The packaging archive type of the component that is being deployed.
           Possible values are as follows:

           car
               The component is packaged as a CAR file.

           ear
               The component is packaged as an EAR file.

           ejb
               The component is an EJB packaged as a JAR file.

           osgi
               The component is packaged as an OSGi bundle.

           rar
               The component is packaged as a RAR file.

           war
               The component is packaged as a WAR file.

       --properties or --property
           Optional keyword-value pairs that specify additional properties for
           the deployment. The available properties are determined by the
           implementation of the component that is being deployed or
           redeployed. The --properties option and the --property option are
           equivalent. You can use either option regardless of the number of
           properties that you specify.

           You can specify the following properties for a deployment:

           jar-signing-alias
               Specifies the alias for the security certificate with which the
               application client container JAR file is signed. Java Web Start
               will not run code that requires elevated permissions unless it
               resides in a JAR file signed with a certificate that the user's
               system trusts. For your convenience, GlassFish Server signs the
               JAR file automatically using the certificate with this alias
               from the domain's keystore. Java Web Start then asks the user
               whether to trust the code and displays the GlassFish Server
               certificate information. To sign this JAR file with a different
               certificate, add the certificate to the domain keystore, then
               use this property. For example, you can use a certificate from
               a trusted authority, which avoids the Java Web Start prompt, or
               from your own company, which users know they can trust. Default
               is s1as, the alias for the self-signed certificate created for
               every domain.

           java-web-start-enabled
               Specifies whether Java Web Start access is permitted for an
               application client module. Default is true.

           compatibility
               Specifies the GlassFish Server release with which to be
               backward compatible in terms of JAR visibility requirements for
               applications. The only allowed value is v2, which refers to Sun
               Java System Application Server version 2 or Sun Java System
               Application Server version 9.1 or 9.1.1. The Java EE 6 platform
               specification imposes stricter requirements than Java EE 5 did
               on which JAR files can be visible to various modules within an
               EAR file. In particular, application clients must not have
               access to EJB JAR files or other JAR files in the EAR file
               unless references use the standard Java SE mechanisms
               (extensions, for example) or the Java EE library-directory
               mechanism. Setting this property to v2 removes these Java EE 6
               restrictions.

           keepSessions={false|true}
               Superseded by the --keepstate option.

               This property can by used to specify whether active sessions of
               the application that is being redeployed are preserved and then
               restored when the redeployment is complete. Applies to HTTP
               sessions in a web container. Default is false.

               false
                   Active sessions of the application are not preserved and
                   restored (default).

               true
                   Active sessions of the application are preserved and
                   restored.

                   If any active session of the application fails to be
                   preserved or restored, none of the sessions will be
                   available when the redeployment is complete. However, the
                   redeployment continues and a warning is logged.

                   To preserve active sessions, GlassFish Server serializes
                   the sessions and saves them in memory. To restore the
                   sessions, the class loader of the newly redeployed
                   application deserializes any sessions that were previously
                   saved.

           preserveAppScopedResources
               If set to true, preserves any application-scoped resources and
               restores them during redeployment. Default is false.

           warlibs={false|true}
               If set to true, enables an application to make use of shared
               libraries installed to `domain_dir/lib/warlibs`.
               Default is false.

           Other available properties are determined by the implementation of
           the component that is being redeployed.

           For components packaged as OSGi bundles (--type=osgi), the deploy
           subcommand accepts properties arguments to wrap a WAR file as a WAB
           (Web Application Bundle) at the time of deployment. The subcommand
           looks for a key named UriScheme and, if present, uses the key as a
           URL stream handler to decorate the input stream. Other properties
           are used in the decoration process. For example, the GlassFish
           Server OSGi web container registers a URL stream handler named
           webbundle, which is used to wrap a plain WAR file as a WAB. For
           more information about usage, see the related example in the
           deploy(1) help page.

OPERANDS
       file_archive|filepath
           The path to the archive that contains the application that is being
           redeployed. This path can be a relative path or an absolute path.

           The archive can be in either of the following formats:

           *   An archive file, for example, /export/JEE_apps/hello.war.

               If the --upload option is set to true, this is the path to the
               deployable file on the local client machine. If the --upload
               option is set to false, this is the absolute path to the file
               on the server machine.

           *   A directory that contains the exploded format of the deployable
               archive. This is the absolute path to the directory on the
               server machine.

               If you specify a directory, the --upload option is ignored.

           Whether this operand is required depends on how the application was
           originally deployed:

           *   If the application was originally deployed from a file, the
               archive-path operand is required. The operand must specify an
               archive file.

           *   If the application was originally deployed from a directory,
               the archive-path operand is optional.

               The operand can specify a directory or an archive file.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Redeploying a Web Application From a File
           This example redeploys the web application hello from the hello.war
           file in the current working directory. The application was
           originally deployed from a file. Active sessions of the application
           are to be preserved and then restored when the redeployment is
           complete.

               asadmin> redeploy --name hello --properties keepSessions=true hello.war
               Application deployed successfully with name hello.
               Command redeploy executed successfully

       Example 2, Redeploying a Web Application From a Directory
           This example redeploys the web application hellodir. The
           application was originally deployed from a directory.

               asadmin> redeploy --name hellodir
               Application deployed successfully with name hellodir.
               Command redeploy executed successfully

EXIT STATUS
       0
           subcommand executed successfully
