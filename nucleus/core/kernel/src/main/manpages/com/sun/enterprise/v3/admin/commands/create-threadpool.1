NAME
       create-threadpool - adds a thread pool

SYNOPSIS
           create-threadpool [--help] [--target target]
           [--maxthreadpoolsize maxthreadpoolsize]
           [--minthreadpoolsize minthreadpoolsize]
           [--idletimeout idletimeout] [--maxqueuesize maxqueuesize]
           [--workqueues workqueues] threadpool-id

DESCRIPTION
       The create-threadpool subcommand creates a thread pool with the
       specified name. You can specify maximum and minimum number of threads
       in the pool, the quantity of messages, and the idle timeout of a
       thread. The created thread pool can be used for servicing IIOP requests
       and for resource adapters to service work management requests. A thread
       pool can be used in multiple resource adapters.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           This option specifies the target on which you are creating the
           thread pool.

           Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Creates the thread pool for the default GlassFish Server
               instance server and is the default value

           configuration-name
               Creates the thread pool for the named configuration.

           instance-name
               Creates the thread pool for a particular instance.

       --maxthreadpoolsize
           Specifies the maximum number of threads the pool can contain.
           Default is 5.

       --minthreadpoolsize
           Specifies the minimum number of threads in the pool. These are
           created when the thread pool is instantiated. Default is 2.

       --idletimeout
           Specifies the amount of time in seconds after which idle threads
           are removed from the pool. Default is 900.

       --maxqueuesize
           Specifies the maximum number of messages that can be queued until
           threads are available to process them for a network listener or
           IIOP listener. A value of -1 specifies no limit. Default is 4096.

       --workqueues
           Do not specify this option. This option is retained for
           compatibility with earlier releases. If you specify this option, a
           syntax error does not occur. Instead, the subcommand runs
           successfully and displays a warning message that the option is
           ignored.

OPERANDS
       threadpool-id
           An ID for the work queue, for example, threadpool-1.
