generate-jvm-report(1)    asadmin Utility Subcommands   generate-jvm-report(1)

NAME
       generate-jvm-report - shows the JVM machine statistics for a given
       target instance

SYNOPSIS
           generate-jvm-report [--help] [--type=jvm-statistic-type] [--target target]

DESCRIPTION
       The generate-jvm-report subcommand creates a report that shows the
       threads (dump of stack trace), classes, memory, or loggers for a given
       target instance, including the domain administration server (DAS). If a
       type is not specified, a summary report is generated. This subcommand
       only provides statistics for the GlassFish Server instance processes.
       This subcommand provides an alternative to sending Ctrl+Break or kill
       -3 signals to GlassFish Server processes to obtain a stack trace for
       processes that are hanging.

       The information in the report is obtained from managed beans (MBeans)
       and MXBeans that are provided in the Java Platform, Standard Edition
       (Java SE ) or JDK software with which GlassFish Server is being used.

       If GlassFish Server is running in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
       software from JDK release 6 or Java SE 6, additional information is
       provided. For example:

       *   System load on the available processors

       *   Object monitors that are currently held or requested by a thread

       *   Lock objects that a thread is holding, for example, ReentrantLock
           objects and ReentrantReadWriteLock objects

       If the JRE software cannot provide this information, the report
       contains the text NOT_AVAILABLE.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which you are showing JVM machine
           statistics.

           Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Specifies the DAS (default).

           instance-name
               Specifies a GlassFish Server instance.

           configuration-name
               Specifies a named configuration.

       --type
           The type of report that is to be generated. Default is summary.

           summary
               Displays summary information about the threads, classes, and
               memory (default).

           memory
               Provides information about heap and non-heap memory
               consumption, memory pools, and garbage collection statistics
               for a given target instance.

           class
               Provides information about the class loader for a given target
               instance.

           thread
               Provides information about threads running and the thread dump
               (stack trace) for a given target instance.

           log
               Provides information about the loggers that are registered in
               the Virtual Machine for the Java platform (Java Virtual Machine
               or JVM machine).The terms "Java Virtual Machine" and "JVM" mean
               a Virtual Machine for the Java platform.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Obtaining Summary Information for the JVM Machine
           This example shows a partial listing of a report that is generated
           if no type is specified. This same report is generated if the
           summary type is specified.
