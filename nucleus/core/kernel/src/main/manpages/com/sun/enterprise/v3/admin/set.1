set(1)                    asadmin Utility Subcommands                   set(1)

NAME
       set - sets the values of configurable attributes

SYNOPSIS
           set [--help] attribute-name=value

DESCRIPTION
       The set subcommand uses dotted names to modify the values of one or
       more configurable attributes.

       Attributes from the monitoring hierarchy are read-only, but
       configuration attributes can be modified. You can use the list(1)
       subcommand to display the dotted names that represent individual server
       components and subsystems. For example, a dotted name might be
       server.applications.web-module. After you discover the particular
       component or subsystem, you can then use the get subcommand to access
       the attributes. For more detailed information on dotted names, see the
       dotted-names(5ASC) help page.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           Characters that have special |
           |           meaning to the shell or      |
           |           command interpreter, such as |
           |           * (asterisk), should be      |
           |           quoted or escaped as         |
           |           appropriate to the shell,    |
           |           for example, by enclosing    |
           |           the argument in quotes. In   |
           |           multimode, quotes are needed |
           |           only for arguments that      |
           |           include spaces, quotes, or   |
           |           backslash.                   |
           +----------------------------------------+

       By modifying attributes, you can enable and disable services, and
       customize how an existing element functions. An asadmin subcommand is
       provided to update some elements. For example, update-password-alias.
       However, to update other elements, you must use the set command. For
       example, you create a JDBC connection pool by using the
       create-jdbc-connection-pool subcommand. To change attribute settings
       later, you use the set command.

       Any change made by using the asadmin utility subcommands or the
       Administration Console are automatically applied to the associated
       GlassFish Server configuration file.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

OPERANDS
       attribute-name=value
           Identifies the full dotted name of the attribute name and its
           value.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Setting a JDBC Connection Pool Attribute
           This example changes the steady pool size of the H2Pool
           connection pool to 9.

               asadmin> set resources.jdbc-connection-pool.H2Pool.steady-pool-size=9
               Command set executed successfully.

       Example 2, Enabling the Monitoring Service for a Monitorable Object
           This example enables monitoring for the JVM.

               asadmin> set server.monitoring-service.module-monitoring-levels.jvm=HIGH
               Command set executed successfully.

       Example 3, Turning on Automatic Recovery for the Transaction Service
           This example turns on automatic recovery for the transaction
           service.

               asadmin> set server.transaction-service.automatic-recovery=true
               Command set executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           subcommand executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the subcommand
