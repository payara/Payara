delete-jvm-options(1)     asadmin Utility Subcommands    delete-jvm-options(1)

NAME
       delete-jvm-options - removes one or more options for the Java
       application launcher

SYNOPSIS
           delete-jvm-options [--help] [--target target] [--profiler={true|false}]
           (jvm-option-name[=jvm-option-value]) [:jvm-option-name[=jvm-option-name]]*

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-jvm-options subcommand removes one or more command-line
       options for the Java application launcher. These options are removed
       from the Java configuration javaâ€”config element or the profiler
       profiler element of the domain.xml file. To see the Java application
       launcher options that can be deleted, use the list-jvm-options(1)
       subcommand.

       The deletion of some options requires a server restart for changes to
       become effective. Other options are set immediately in the environment
       of the domain administration server (DAS) and do not require a restart.

       Whether a restart is required depends on the type of option.

       *   Restart is not required for Java system properties whose names do
           not start with -Djava.  or -Djavax.  (including the trailing
           period). For example, restart is not required for the following
           Java system property:

           -Denvironment=Production

       *   Restart is required for the following options:

           *   Java system properties whose names start with -Djava.  or
               -Djavax.  (including the trailing period). For example:

               -Djava.security.manager

           *   Startup parameters for the Java application launcher. For
               example:

               -client

               -Xmx1024m

               -d64

       To restart the DAS, use the restart-domain(1) command.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target from which you are removing Java application
           launcher options.

           Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Specifies the DAS (default).

           instance-name
               Specifies a GlassFish Server instance.

           cluster-name
               Specifies a cluster.

           configuration-name
               Specifies a named configuration.

       --profiler
           Indicates whether the Java application launcher options are for the
           profiler. The option must have been set for a profiler for this
           option to be true.

OPERANDS
       jvm-option-name
           One or more options delimited by a colon (:). The format of the
           operand depends on the following:

           *   If the option has a name and a value, the format is
               option-name=value.

           *   If the option has only a name, the format is option-name. For
               example, -Xmx2048m.

               Note
               +----------------------------------------+
               |If an option name or option value       |
               |contains a colon, the backslash (\)     |
               |must be used to escape the colon in the |
               |name or value. Other characters might   |
               |also require an escape character. For   |
               |more information about escape           |
               |characters in subcommand options, see   |
               |the asadmin(1M) man page.               |
