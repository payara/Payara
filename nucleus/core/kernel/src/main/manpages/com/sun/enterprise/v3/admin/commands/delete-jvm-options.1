delete-jvm-options(1)     asadmin Utility Subcommands    delete-jvm-options(1)

NAME
       delete-jvm-options - removes one or more options for the Java
       application launcher

SYNOPSIS
           delete-jvm-options [--help] [--target target]
           (jvm-option-name[=jvm-option-value]) [:jvm-option-name[=jvm-option-name]]*

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-jvm-options subcommand removes one or more command-line
       options for the Java application launcher. These options are removed
       from the Java configuration java—config element. To see the Java application
       launcher options that can be deleted, use the list-jvm-options(1)
       subcommand.

       The deletion of some options requires a server restart for changes to
       become effective. Other options are set immediately in the environment
       of the domain administration server (DAS) and do not require a restart.

       Whether a restart is required depends on the type of option.

       *   Restart is not required for Java system properties whose names do
           not start with -Djava.  or -Djavax.  (including the trailing
           period). For example, restart is not required for the following
           Java system property:

           -Denvironment=Production

       *   Restart is required for the following options:

           *   Java system properties whose names start with -Djava.  or
               -Djavax.  (including the trailing period). For example:

               -Djava.security.manager

           *   Startup parameters for the Java application launcher. For
               example:

               -client

               -Xmx1024m

               -d64

       To restart the DAS, use the restart-domain(1) command.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target from which you are removing Java application
           launcher options.

           Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Specifies the DAS (default).

           instance-name
               Specifies a GlassFish Server instance.

           configuration-name
               Specifies a named configuration.

OPERANDS
       jvm-option-name
           One or more options delimited by a colon (:). The format of the
           operand depends on the following:

           *   If the option has a name and a value, the format is
               option-name=value.

           *   If the option has only a name, the format is option-name. For
               example, -Xmx2048m.

               Note
               +----------------------------------------+
               |If an option name or option value       |
               |contains a colon, the backslash (\)     |
               |must be used to escape the colon in the |
               |name or value. Other characters might   |
               |also require an escape character. For   |
               |more information about escape           |
               |characters in subcommand options, see   |
               |the asadmin(1M) man page.               |
