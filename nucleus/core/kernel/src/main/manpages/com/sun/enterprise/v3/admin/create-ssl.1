           create-ssl [--help]
           [--target target]
           --type listener_or_service_type
           --certname cert_name
           [--ssl3tlsciphers ssl3tlsciphers]

           [listener_id]

DESCRIPTION
       The create-ssl subcommand creates and configures the SSL element in the
       selected HTTP listener, IIOP listener, or IIOP service to enable secure
       communication on that listener/service.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       If an option has a short option name, then the short option precedes
       the long option name. Short options have one dash whereas long options
       have two dashes.

       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target on which you are configuring the ssl element.
           The following values are valid:

           server
               Specifies the server in which the iiop-service or HTTP/IIOP
               listener is to be configured for SSL.

           config
               Specifies the configuration that contains the HTTP/IIOP
               listener or iiop-service for which SSL is to be configured.

           instance
               Specifies the instance in which the HTTP/IIOP listener or
               iiop-service is to be configured for SSL.

       --type
           The type of service or listener for which the SSL is created. The
           type can be:

           *   network-listener

           *   http-listener

           *   iiop-listener

           *   iiop-service

           *   jmx-connector

           When the type is iiop-service, the ssl-client-config along with the
           embedded ssl element is created in domain.xml.

       --certname
           The nickname of the server certificate in the certificate database
           or the PKCS#11 token. The format of the name in the certificate is
           tokenname:nickname. For this property, the tokenname: is optional.

       --ssl3tlsciphers
           A comma-separated list of the SSL3 and/or TLS ciphers to be used.
           Ciphers not explicitly listed will be disabled for the target, even
           if those ciphers are available in the particular cipher suite you
           are using. If this option is not used, all supported ciphers are
           assumed to be enabled. Allowed values are:

           *   SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5

           *   SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA

           *   SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA

           *   SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5

           *   SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_MD5

           *   SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA

           *   SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA

       --tlsrollbackenabled
           Set to true (default) to enable TLS rollback. TLS rollback should
           be enabled for Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 and 5.5. This option
           is only valid when -tlsenabled=true.

       --clientauthenabled
           Set to true if you want client authentication performed on
           every request independent of ACL-based access control. Default
           value is false.

OPERANDS
       listener_id
           The ID of the HTTP or IIOP listener for which the SSL element is to
           be created. The listener_id is not required if the --type is
           iiop-service.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating an SSL element for an HTTP listener
           The following example shows how to create an SSL element for an
           HTTP listener named http-listener-1.

               asadmin> create-ssl
               --type http-listener
               --certname sampleCert http-listener-1
               Command create-ssl executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           subcommand executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the subcommand
