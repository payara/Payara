create-system-properties(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands  create-system-properties(1)

NAME
       create-system-properties - adds one or more system property elements
       that can be referenced elsewhere in the configuration.

SYNOPSIS
           create-system-properties [--help]
           [--target target]
           [name=value)[:name=value]*]

DESCRIPTION
       The create-system-properties subcommand adds or updates system
       properties that can be referenced elsewhere on the server.

       GlassFish Server provides hooks where tokens (system properties) can be
       specified. Because GlassFish Server does not have multiple server
       elements, you can specify a particular token at any level. When a
       domain supports multiple servers, the override potential can be
       exploited. When a domain is started or restarted, all <system-property>
       elements are resolved and available to the Java Virtual Machine by
       using the System.setProperty() call on each of them (with its name and
       value derived from the corresponding attributes of the element). This
       is analogous to sending the elements as -D parameters on the Java
       command line.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           The target on which you are creating the system properties.

OPERANDS
       target
           The valid targets for this subcommand are instance,
           configuration, domain, and server. Server is the default option.
           Valid values are:

           server
               Creates the properties on the default server instance. This is
               the default value.

           domain
               Creates the properties for all server instances in the default
               domain.

           configuration_name
               Creates the properties in the specified configuration.

           instance_name
               Creates the properties on a specified server instance.

       name=value
           The name value pairs of the system properties to add to the
           specified target. Multiple system properties must be separated by a
           : (colon). If a : (colon) appears in the name or value of a system
           property, it must be escaped with a \ (blackslash). If any system
           properties were previously defined, they are updated with the new
           values.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating System Properties

           listener on a server instance named myserver.
