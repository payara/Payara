attach(1)                 asadmin Utility Subcommands                attach(1)

NAME
       attach - attaches to subcommands that were started using asadmin
       --detach or that contain progress information

SYNOPSIS
           attach  [--help]
           job_id

DESCRIPTION
       The attach subcommand attaches to subcommands that were started using
       the asadmin utility option --detach or that contain progress
       information. The --detach option detaches long-running subcommands and
       executes them in the background in detach mode.

       Job IDs are assigned to the subcommands (jobs), and can be used to view
       the status of a job and its output. Use the list-jobs(1) subcommand to
       view the jobs and their job IDs, and the configure-managed-jobs(1)
       subcommand to configure how long information about the jobs is kept.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

OPERANDS
       job_id
           The ID of the job for which you want to view status and output.

EXAMPLES

           Uploading bits.
