create-jvm-option(1)     asadmin Utility Subcommands    create-jvm-option(1)

NAME
       create-jvm-option - creates a single option for the Java application launcher

SYNOPSIS
           create-jvm-option [--help] [--target target]
           (assignment=jvm-option)

DESCRIPTION
       The create-jvm-option subcommand is a singular version of the
       create-jvm-options(1) subcommand and creates command-line options that
       are passed to the Java application launcher when Payara Server is
       started. The options that this subcommand creates are in addition to
       the options that are preset with Payara Server. Java application
       launcher options are stored in the Java configuration java—config
       element. The options are sent to the command line in the order
       they appear in the java—config element.

       This subcommand can be used to create the following types of options:

       *   Java system properties.  These options are set through the -D
           option of the Java application launcher. For example:

           -Djava.security.manager

           -Denvironment=Production

       *   Startup parameters for the Java application launcher.  These
           options are preceded by the dash character (-). For example:

           --XX:PermSize=size

           -Xmx1024m

           -d64

       If the subcommand specifies an option that already exists, the command
       does not re-create it.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           Ensure that any option that  |
           |           you create is valid. The     |
           |           subcommand might allow you   |
           |           to create an invalid option, |
           |           but such an invalid option   |
           |           can cause startup to fail.   |
           +----------------------------------------+

       An option can be verified by examining the server log after GlassFish
       Server starts. Options for the Java application launcher are written to
       the server.log file before any other information when GlassFish Server
       starts.

       The addition of some options requires a server restart for changes to
       become effective. Other options are set immediately in the environment
       of the domain administration server (DAS) and do not require a restart.
       Whether a restart is required depends on the type of option.

       *   Restart is not required for Java system properties whose names do
           not start with -Djava.  or -Djavax.  (including the trailing
           period). For example, restart is not required for the following
           Java system property:

           -Denvironment=Production

       *   Restart is required for the following options:

           *   Java system properties whose names start with -Djava.  or
               -Djavax.  (including the trailing period). For example:

               -Djava.security.manager

           *   Startup parameters for the Java application launcher. For
               example:

               -client

               -Xmx1024m

               -d64

       To restart the DAS, use the restart-domain(1) command.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target on which you are creating Java application
           launcher options.

           Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Specifies the DAS (default).

           instance-name
               Specifies a GlassFish Server instance.

           cluster-name
               Specifies a cluster.

           configuration-name
               Specifies a named configuration.

OPERANDS
       assignment
           A single option assignment. The format of an option depends
           on the following:

           *   If the option has a name and a value, the format is
               option-name=value.

           *   If the option has only a name, the format is option-name. For
               example, -Xmx2048m.

           *   If the first option name could be misinterpreted as one or more
               asadmin short options, the format is -- option-name. For
               example, -server in the following command could be
               misinterpreted as -se, the asadmin short forms for --secure and
               --echo:

                   create-jvm-option -server
               To create the JVM option -server, instead use the command:

                   create-jvm-option -- -server

               Note
               +-----------------------------------------+
               | If an option name or option value       |
               | contains a colon, the backslash (\)     |
               | must be used to escape the colon in the |
               | name or value. Other characters might   |
               | also require an escape character. For   |
               | more information about escape           |
               | characters in subcommand options, see   |
               | the asadmin(1M) man page.               |
