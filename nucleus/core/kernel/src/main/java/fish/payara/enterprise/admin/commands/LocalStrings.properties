joe.exists=JVM option {0} already exists in the configuration.
joe.invalid.start=JVM option {0} is invalid because it does not start with a ''-''
joe.invalid.cmd.syntax=The command line:{0} does not satisfy the syntax.\nIn a nutshell, all options should start with a ''-'', multiple options are separated by a '':''.\nA '':'' inside an option should be escaped with a ''\\''.\nSince shell interprets command arguments, make sure you quote it.\n
soft.invalid.xmx=It appears that given JVM option {0} represents invalid maximum heap for the JVM. Ensure that it is valid, by doing list-jvm-options.
soft.xmx.exists.singular=The previously configured maximum heap size ({0}) will be replaced by the new configuration: {1}
soft.xmx.smaller.than.xms=It appears that the maximum heap size specified: {0} is smaller than the minimum heap size in the configuration: {1}. JVM might not start. Ensure that this is valid, by doing doing list-jvm-options.
soft.invalid.xms=It appears that given JVM option {0} represents invalid initial heap for the JVM. Ensure that it is valid, by doing list-jvm-options.
soft.xms.exists.singular=The previously configured initial heap size ({0}) will be replaced by the new configuration: {1}
soft.xms.larger.than.xmx=It appears that the initial heap size specified: {0} is larger than the maximum heap size in the configuration: {1}. JVM might not start. Ensure that this is valid, by doing doing list-jvm-options.
jvm.option.created=Successfully added JVM option: {0}
no.option.created=No jvm-options were created (perhaps they were already present)
create.jvm.options.failed=Command: create-jvm-options failed. {0}
