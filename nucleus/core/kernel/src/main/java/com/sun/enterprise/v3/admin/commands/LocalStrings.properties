soft.invalid.xmx=It appears that given JVM option {0} represents invalid maximum heap for the JVM. Ensure that it is valid, by doing list-jvm-options.
soft.xmx.exists=The configuration already has maximum heap size specified: {0}. Verify the java configuration by doing list-jvm-options.
soft.xmx.smaller.than.xms=It appears that the maximum heap size specified: {0} is smaller than the minimum heap size in the configuration: {1}. JVM might not start. Ensure that this is valid, by doing doing list-jvm-options.
soft.invalid.xms=It appears that given JVM option {0} represents invalid initial heap for the JVM. Ensure that it is valid, by doing list-jvm-options.
soft.xms.exists=The configuration already has initial heap size specified: {0}. Verify the java configuration by doing list-jvm-options.
soft.xms.larger.than.xmx=It appears that the initial heap size specified: {0} is larger than the maximum heap size in the configuration: {1}. JVM might not start. Ensure that this is valid, by doing doing list-jvm-options.
