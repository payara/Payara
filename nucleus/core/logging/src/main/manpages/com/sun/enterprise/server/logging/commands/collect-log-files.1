collect-log-files(1)      asadmin Utility Subcommands     collect-log-files(1)

NAME
       collect-log-files - creates a ZIP archive of all available log files

SYNOPSIS
           collect-log-files [--help] [--target target]
           [--retrieve={false|true}] [retrievefilepath]]

DESCRIPTION
       The collect-log-files subcommand collects all available log files for
       the domain administration server (DAS), the specified deployment group, or the
       specified GlassFish Server instance and creates a single ZIP archive of
       the log files.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --retrieve
           Specifies whether the ZIP archive is created in a directory other
           than the default directory.

           By default the ZIP archive is created in the
           domain-dir/collected-logs directory. The ZIP file names are
           constructed from the specified target and timestamp, as follows:

               log_yyyy-mm-dd_hh-min-sec.zip
           Possible values are as follows:

           false
               The ZIP archive will be created in the default directory. If
               omitted, the --retrieve option defaults to false.

           true
               The ZIP archive will be created in the directory that the
               retrievefilepath operand specifies. If retrievefilepath is
               omitted, the ZIP archive will be created in the default
               directory.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which log files will be collected.

           Possible values are as follows:

           server
               The log files will be collected for the DAS (default).

           instance-name
               The log files will be collected for the specified Payara
               Server instance.

           deployment-group-name
               The log files will be collected for the specified deployment group

OPERANDS
       retrievefilepath
           The name of the directory in which the ZIP archive will be created.
           If this operand is omitted, the ZIP archive will be created in the
           default directory. If the --retrieve option is false, this operand
           is ignored.

           deployment group named cluster1 and the two server instances running
           in the group.

               asadmin> collect-log-files --target cluster1
               Log files are downloaded for instance1.
