rotate-log(1)             asadmin Utility Subcommands            rotate-log(1)

NAME
       rotate-log - rotates the log file

SYNOPSIS
           rotate-log [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       The rotate-log subcommand rotates the server log by renaming the file
       with a timestamp name in the format server.log_date-and-time, and
       creating a new log file. Changes take effect dynamically, that is,
       server restart is not required.

       The size of the log queue is configurable through the
       logging.properties file. Log rotation is based on file size or elapsed
       time since the last log rotation. In some circumstances, the queue
       might fill up, especially if the log level is set to FINEST and there
       is heavy activity on the server. In this case, the rotate-log
       subcommand can be used to rotate the server log immediately. This
       subcommand is also useful in creating scripts for rotating the log at
       convenient times.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           The server, cluster, or server instance for which logs will be
           rotated. If this option is omitted, logs are rotated for the
           default server.

OPERANDS
       target
           Valid values are:

           *   server_name - Default target is server. If no target is
               specified then logs are rotated for the server.

           *   instance_name - The name of a target server instance.
