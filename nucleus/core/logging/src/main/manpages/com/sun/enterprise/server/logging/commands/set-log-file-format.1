NAME
       set-log-file-format - sets the formatter to be used for the server log
       file

SYNOPSIS
           set-log-file-format [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       The set-log-file-format subcommand sets the formatter to be used for
       the server log file for the specified target.

       GlassFish Server provides the ULF (UniformLogFormatter) and ODL (Oracle
       Diagnostics Logging) formatters. A custom formatter can also be used by
       specifying the fully qualified name of a class that extends the
       java.util.logging.Formatter class.

       The custom formatter class can be packaged in a JAR file and placed in
       domain/lib/ext, or implemented as an HK2 service and the JAR containing
       the formatter implementation installed in glassfish/modules.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which the formatter is being set. Specify
           the name of the server domain or instance. If this option
           is omitted, logger attributes are set for the default server.
