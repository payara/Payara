/**
 * Represents an internal system admin.
 * <p>
 * An internal system admin is useful for running commands using
 * the command framework from trusted server code that does not have a
 * previously-authenticated subject on whose behalf the work is being done.
 * For example, autodeployment runs automatically, without a user-linked
 * subject, and internally submits a "deploy" command for execution.
 * <p>
 * It's safer to require such uses to specify an internal system admin rather than
 * to assume that if no subject is specified to authorization then it should
 * be treated as a system admin.
