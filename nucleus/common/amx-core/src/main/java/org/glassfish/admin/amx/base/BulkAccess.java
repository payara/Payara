/**
Bulk access to various JMX constructs. The term "bulk" refers to the fact the multiple
MBeans are accessed together on the server side, to minimize remote
invocation of many MBeans.
<p>
Because a failure can occur with a particular MBeans, results or failures are
communicated back in an array of the exact size of the original ObjectName[].
Examining the results array yields either the result, or a Throwable, if one
occured.  This is why all results are of type Object[].
<p>
Clients wishing to use this interface should note that they may first
need to obtain an ObjectName[] from a Set or Map of {@link AMXProxy}.  The easiest way
to do this is to use {@link Util#toObjectNames} followed by
conversion of the Set to an ObjectName[].
