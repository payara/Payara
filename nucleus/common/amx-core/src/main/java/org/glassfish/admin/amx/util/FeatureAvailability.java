/**
Central registry of available features for fine-grained dependency enforcement in a
threaded environment.
<p>
Providers of features can register the availability (initializated and ready-to-use)
of a particular feature, upon which other code depends.  See {@link #registerFeature}.
<p>
Code that requires an initialized and ready-to-use feature should call
{@link #waitForFeature}--the calling thread will block until that feature is available.
<p>
Feature names are arbitrary and *should not* be defined as 'public static final String' in this
class unless they are of general system interest.  Features that are <i>not</i> of general interest
can and should still be registered through this mechanism,
but the names of those features and the associated data can be defined in a more appropriate place.
<p>
<b>Provider Example</b><br>
<pre>
...provider runs in its own thread...
FeatureAvailability.registerFeature( FeatureAvailability.MBEAN_SERVER_FEATURE, mbeanServer );
</pre><p>
<b>Client Example</b><br>
(arbitrary number of clients, multiple calls OK)</br>
<pre>
...client runs until feature is needed...
final MBeanServer mbeanServer = (MBeanServer)
FeatureAvailability.waitForFeature( FeatureAvailability.MBEAN_SERVER_FEATURE );
</pre>
<p>
To see how long client code is blocking, set the {@link #DEBUG_ENABLED} flag to true.
