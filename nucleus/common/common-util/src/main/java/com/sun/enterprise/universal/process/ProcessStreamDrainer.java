/**
 * If you don't drain a process' stdout and stderr it will cause a deadlock after a few hundred bytes of output.
 * At that point the Process is blocked because its stdout and/or stderr buffer is full and it is waiting for the Java caller
 * to drain it.  Meanwhile the Java program is blocked waiting on the external process.
 * This class makes this common, but messy and tricky, procedure easier.
 * It creates 2 threads that drain output on stdout and stderr of the external process.
 * <p> Sample Code:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("ls",  "-R", "c:/as");
 * try
 * {
 *      Process p = pb.start();
 *      ProcessStreamDrainer psd = ProcessStreamDrainer.drain("MyProcess", p);
 *      // or
 *      ProcessStreamDrainer psd = ProcessStreamDrainer.redirect("MyProcess", p);
 *      psd.waitFor(); // this is optional.
 * }
 * catch (Exception ex)
 * {
 *      ex.printStackTrace();
 * }
 * </pre>
