/**
 * A replacement for System Properties
 * An InheritableThreadLocal is used to store the "impl".  This means that the
 * initial thread that uses this class -- and all its sub-threads will get the
 * same System Properties.
 * Make sure that you don't create it from the main Thread -- otherwise all instances
 * will get the same props.
 * E.g.
 * main thread creates instance1-thread and instance2-thread
 * The 2 created threads should each call init() -- but the main thread should not.
 * In the usual case where there is just one instance in the JVM -- this class is also
 * perfectly usable.  Just call any method when you need something.
