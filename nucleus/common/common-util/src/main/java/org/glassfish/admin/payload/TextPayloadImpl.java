/**
 * Implements the Payload API for a message containing only a single text part.
 * <p>
 * This class is mainly useful so the RemoteCommand logic can treat the return
 * payload from a command the same, regardless of whether it is actually
 * a text-only payload (containing only the command report text itself) or
 * a multi-part payload with different Parts.
 * <p>
 * This class is here primarily to make the plain text in a response look like
 * the more general multi-part responses so the RemoteCommand class is free
 * from dealing with the details of payload formatting - in particular, free
 * from knowing how to tell if the payload contains just the text report or
 * contains other parts as well.
 * <p>
 * Note that if an outbound payload contains only one Part then, currently, the
 * Payload.Outbound.Impl.writeTo method copies the contents of that Part into
 * the request or response stream rather than writing a multi-part payload that
 * contains a single part.  This is for compatibility with existing clients
 * (such as NetBeans) which expect only the text report as the return payload.
