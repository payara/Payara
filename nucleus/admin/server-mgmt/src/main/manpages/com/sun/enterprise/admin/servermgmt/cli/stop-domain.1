stop-domain(1)            asadmin Utility Subcommands           stop-domain(1)

NAME
       stop-domain - stops the Domain Administration Server of the specified
       domain

SYNOPSIS
           stop-domain [--help] [--domaindir domaindir]
           [--force={true|false}] [--kill={false|true}]
           [--timeout timeout][domain-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The stop-domain subcommand stops the Domain Administration Server (DAS)
       of the specified domain. If the domain directory is not specified, the
       domain in the default domains directory is stopped. If there are two or
       more domains in the domains directory, the domain-name operand must be
       specified.

       This subcommand is supported in local or remote mode. If you specify a
       host name and it references a remote host, the subcommand assumes you
       are operating in remote mode, which means you must correctly authenticate
       to the remote server. If the host name points to localhost, then the
       subcommand assumes you are operating in local mode as if the host name
       wasn't specified at all. In local mode, you normally do not need to
       authenticate to the server as long as you are running the subcommand as
       the same user who started the server.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --domaindir
           Specifies the directory of the domain that is to be stopped. If
           specified, the path must be accessible in the file system. If not
           specified, the domain in the default as-install/domains directory
           is stopped.

       --force
           Specifies whether the domain is forcibly stopped immediately.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The domain is forcibly stopped immediately (default).

           false
               The subcommand waits until all threads that are associated with
               the domain are exited before stopping the domain.

       --kill
           Specifies whether the domain is killed by using functionality of
           the operating system to terminate the domain process.

           Possible values are as follows:

           false
               The domain is not killed. The subcommand uses functionality of
               the Java platform to terminate the domain process (default).

           true
               The domain is killed. The subcommand uses functionality of the
               operating system to terminate the domain process.

       --timeout
           Specifies the amount of time in seconds the command will run for
           before timing out. Default is 60 seconds.

OPERANDS
       domain-name
           The name of the domain you want to stop. Default is the name
           specified during installation, usually domain1.
