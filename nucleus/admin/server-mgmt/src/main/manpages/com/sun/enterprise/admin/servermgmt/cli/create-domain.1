DESCRIPTION
       The create-domain subcommand creates a GlassFish Server domain. A
       domain in GlassFish Server is an administrative namespace that complies
       with the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) standard. Every
       domain has a configuration, which is stored in a set of files. Any
       number of domains, each of which has a distinct administrative
       identity, can be created in a given installation of GlassFish Server. A
       domain can exist independently of other domains.

       Any user who has access to the asadmin utility on a given system can
       create a domain and store its configuration in a folder of the user's
       choosing. By default, the domain configuration is created in the
       default directory for domains. You can override this location to store
       the configuration elsewhere.

       If domain customizers are found in JAR files in the as-install/modules
       directory when the create-domain subcommand is run, the customizers are
       processed. A domain customizer is a class that implements the
       DomainInitializer interface.

       The create-domain subcommand creates a domain with a single
       administrative user specified by the asadmin utility option --user. If
       the --user option is not specified, and the --nopassword option is set
       to true, the default administrative user, admin, is used. If the
       --nopassword option is set to false (the default), a username is
       required. In this case, if you have not specified the user name by
       using the --user option, you are prompted to do so.

       You choose an appropriate profile for the domain, depending on the
       applications that you want to run on your new domain. You can choose
       the developer, cluster, or enterprise profile for the domain you
       create.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --adminport
           The HTTP port or the HTTPS port for administration. This port is
           the port in the URL that you specify in your web browser to manage
           the domain, for example, http://localhost:4949. The --adminport
           option cannot be used with the --portbase option. The default value
           is 4848.

           The --adminport option overrides the domain.adminPort property of
           the --domainproperties option.

       --instanceport
           The domain provides services so that applications can run when
           deployed. This HTTP port specifies where the web application
           context roots are available for a web browser to connect to. This
           port is a positive integer and must be available at the time of
           domain creation. The --instanceport option cannot be used with the
           --portbase option. The default value is 8080.

           The --instanceport option overrides the domain.instancePort
           property of the --domainproperties option.

       --portbase
           Determines the number with which port assignments should start. A
           domain uses a certain number of ports that are statically assigned.
           The portbase value determines where the assignment should start.
           The values for the ports are calculated as follows:

           *   Administration port: portbase + 48

           *   HTTP listener port: portbase + 80

           *   HTTPS listener port: portbase + 81

           *   JMS port: portbase + 76

           *   IIOP listener port: portbase + 37

           *   Secure IIOP listener port: portbase + 38

           *   Secure IIOP with mutual authentication port: portbase + 39

           *   JMX port: portbase + 86

           *   JPDA debugger port: portbase + 9

           *   Felix shell service port for OSGi module management: portbase +
               66
           
           *   Hazelcast DAS port: portbase + 49
           
           *   Hazelcast Start port: portbase + 59

           When the --portbase option is specified, the output of this
           subcommand includes a complete list of used ports.

           The --portbase option cannot be used with the --adminport,
           --instanceport, or the --domainproperties option.

       --template
           The file name, including a relative or absolute path, of a domain
           configuration template to use for creating the domain. If a
           relative path is specified, the subcommand appends the path to the
           as-install/lib/templates directory to locate the file. If it is an
           absolute pathname, the subcommand locates the file in the specified
           path.

           This option enables domains of different types to be created and
           custom domain templates to be defined.

       --domaindir
           The directory where the domain is to be created. If specified, the
           path must be accessible in the filesystem. If not specified, the
           domain is created in the default domain directory,
           as-install/domains.

       --savemasterpassword
           Setting this option to true allows the master password to be
           written to the file system. If this option is true, the
           --usemasterpassword option is also true, regardless of the value
           that is specified on the command line. The default value is false.

           A master password is really a password for the secure key store. A
           domain is designed to keep its own certificate (created at the time
           of domain creation) in a safe place in the configuration location.
           This certificate is called the domain's SSL server certificate.
           When the domain is contacted by a web browser over a secure channel
           (HTTPS), this certificate is presented by the domain. The master
           password is supposed to protect the store (a file) that contains
           this certificate. This file is called keystore.p12 and is created
           in the configuration directory of the domain created. If however,
           this option is chosen, the master password is saved on the disk in
           the domain's configuration location. The master password is stored
           in a file called master-password, which is a Java JCEKS type
           keystore. The reason for using the --savemasterpassword option is
           for unattended system boots. In this case, the master password is
           not prompted for when the domain starts because the password will
           be extracted from this file.

           It is best to create a master password when creating a domain,
           because the master password is used by the start-domain subcommand.
           For security purposes, the default setting should be false, because
           saving the master password on the disk is an insecure practice,
           unless file system permissions are properly set. If the master
           password is saved, then start-domain does not prompt for it. The
           master password gives an extra level of security to the
           environment.

       --masterpasswordlocation
           Only applies if the --savemasterpassword parameter is set to true.
           This parameter receives an absolute filepath that the master password
           will be saved to.

       --usemasterpassword
           Specifies whether the key store is encrypted with a master password
           that is built into the system or a user-defined master password.

           If false (default), the keystore is encrypted with a well-known
           password that is built into the system. Encrypting the keystore
           with a password that is built into the system provides no
           additional security.

           If true, the subcommand obtains the master password from the
           AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD entry in the password file or prompts for
           the master password. The password file is specified in the
           --passwordfile option of the asadmin(1M)utility.

           If the --savemasterpassword option is true, this option is also
           true, regardless of the value that is specified on the command
           line.
        
       --hazelcastdasport
           The port to run Hazelcast on for the DAS. If this port is busy, 
           the port specified will be incremented until a valid port is found.
           The --hazelcastdasport option cannot be used with the --portbase 
           option. The default value is 4900.

           The --hazelcastdasport option overrides the hazelcast.das.port 
           property of the --domainproperties option.
        
       --hazelcaststartport
           The port the other Payara Server instances use to run Hazelcast on. 
           If this port is busy, the port specified will be incremented until 
           a valid port is found. The --hazelcaststartport option cannot be 
           used with the --portbase option. The default value is 5900.

           The --hazelcaststartport option overrides the hazelcast.start.port 
           property of the --domainproperties option.

       --hazelcastautoincrement
           By default the cluster uses the next unoccupied port that is 
           available starting with the start port. When auto-increment is 
           turned off an occupied start port results in a startup failure 
           instead.

           The --hazelcastautoincrement option overrides the 
           hazelcast.auto.increment property of the --domainproperties option.

       --domainproperties
           Setting the optional name/value pairs overrides the default values
           for the properties of the domain to be created. The list must be
           separated by the colon (:) character. The --portbase options cannot
           be used with the --domainproperties option. The following
           properties are available:

           domain.adminPort

               --hazelcastdasport option.

           hazelcast.start.port
               This property specifies the port number of the port the other 
               Payara Server instances use to run Hazelcast on. If this port is 
               busy, the port specified will be incremented until a valid port 
               is found. Valid values are 1-65535. On UNIX, creating sockets 
               that listen on ports 1-1024 requires superuser privileges.
           
               The hazelcast.start.port property is overridden by the 
               --hazelcaststartport option.

           hazelcast.auto.increment
               This property specifies whether or not to use the next unoccupied
               port that is available starting with the start port. When 
               auto-increment is turned off an occupied start port results in a 
               startup failure instead.
               
               
               The hazelcast.auto.increment property is overridden by the 
               --hazelcastautoincrement option.

       --keytooloptions
           Specifies an optional list of name-value pairs of keytool options
           for a self-signed server certificate. The certificate is generated
           during the creation of the domain. Each pair in the list must be
           separated by the colon (:) character.

           Allowed options are as follows:

           CN
               Specifies the common name of the host that is to be used for
               the self-signed certificate. This option name is case
               insensitive.

               By default, the name is the fully-qualified name of the host
               where the create-domain subcommand is run.

       --savelogin
           If set to true, this option saves the administration user name and
           password. Default value is false. The username and password are
           stored in the .asadminpass file in user's home directory. A domain
           can only be created locally. Therefore, when using the --savelogin
           option, the host name saved in .asadminpass is always localhost. If
           the user has specified default administration port while creating
           the domain, there is no need to specify --user, --passwordfile,
           --host, or --port on any of the subsequent asadmin remote commands.
           These values will be obtained automatically.

               Note
               +----------------------------------------+
               |When the same user creates multiple     |
               |domains that have the same              |
               |administration port number on the same  |
               |or different host (where the home       |
               |directory is NFS mounted), the          |
               |subcommand does not ask if the password |
               |should be overwritten. The password     |
               |will always be overwritten.             |
               +----------------------------------------+

       --checkports
           Specifies whether to check for the availability of the
           administration, HTTP, JMS, JMX, and IIOP ports. The default value
           is true.

       --nopassword
           Specifies whether the administrative user will have a password. If
           false (the default), the password is specified by the
           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD entry in the asadmin password file (set by using
           the --passwordfile option). If false and the AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD is
           not set, you are prompted for the password.

           If true, the administrative user is created without a password. If
           a user name for the domain is not specified by using the --user
           option, and the --nopassword option is set to true, the default
           user name, admin, is used.

OPERANDS
       domain-name
           The name of the domain to be created. The name may contain only
           ASCII characters and must be a valid directory name for the
           operating system on the host where the domain is created.
