DESCRIPTION
       The list-domains subcommand lists the domains in the specified domains
       directory. If the domains directory is not specified, the domains in
       the default directory are listed. If there is more that one domains
       directory, the --domaindir option must be specified. The status of each
       domain is included.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

       --domaindir
           The directory where the domains are to be listed. If specified, the
           path must be accessible in the files stem. If not specified, the
           domains in the domain root directory are listed. The default
           location of the domain root directory is as-install/domains.

       --long, -l
           Displays detailed information about the administration servers in
           the listed domains, including host names and port numbers. The
           default value is false.

       --header, -h
           Specifies whether a header is displayed when the --long option is
