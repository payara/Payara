change-admin-password(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands  change-admin-password(1)

NAME
       change-admin-password - changes the administrator password

SYNOPSIS
           change-admin-password [--help]
           [--domaindir domain-root-dir [--domain_name domain-name]]

DESCRIPTION
       The change-admin-password subcommand modifies the administrator
       password. The change-admin-password subcommand is interactive because
       the subcommand prompts the user for the old administrator password, for
       the new administrator password, and for confirmation of the new
       administrator password. The new password must contain at least 8
       characters.

       If the only user is an anonymous user without a password, this
       subcommand fails.

       If a blank password is provided, this subcommand fails if secure
       administration is enabled.

       For security purposes, create a password-protected user account with
       administrator privileges. To create this account, use the
       create-file-user(1) or the Administration Console. After creating this
       user account, remove the anonymous user to restrict access to GlassFish
       Server settings.

       If more than one administrator is configured for GlassFish Server, you
       must run the asadmin command with the --user option to change the
       password for that user. For more information, see the examples in this
       help page.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode and remote mode. If the
       --domaindir or --domain_name option is specified, the
       change-admin-password subcommand operates in local mode. If neither
       option is specified, the change-admin-password subcommand first
       attempts to operate in remote mode. If neither option is specified and
       the DAS is not running, the change-admin-password subcommand operates
       in local mode, using the default values for the --domaindir and
       --domain_name options.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --domaindir
           Specifies the parent directory of the domain specified in the
           --domain_name option. When this option is used, the
           change-admin-password subcommand operates in local mode.

       --domain_name
           Specifies the domain of the admin user.

           This option is not required if the directory specified by the
           --domaindir option contains only one domain.
