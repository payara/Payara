change-master-password(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands  change-master-password(1)

NAME
       change-master-password - changes the master password

SYNOPSIS
           change-master-password [--help] [--nodedir node-dir] [--domaindir domain-dir]
            [--savemasterpassword={false|true}] [domain-name|node-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The change-master-password subcommand is used to modify the master
       password. The change-master-password subcommand is interactive in that
       the user is prompted for the old master password, as well as the new
       master password. This subcommand will not work unless the server is
       stopped. In a distributed environment, this command must run on each
       machine in the domain.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --nodedir
           The name of the directory containing the node instance for which
           the password will be changed. If this option is omitted, the change
           is applied to the entire domain.

       --domaindir
           The name of the domain directory used for this operation. By
           default, the --domaindir option is $AS_DEF_DOMAINS_PATH, which is
           an environment variable defined in the file asenv.bat or
           asenv.conf.

       --savemasterpassword
           This option indicates whether the master password should be written
           to the file system. This is necessary so that the start-domain(1)
           command can start the server without having to prompt the user.

           The default is false.

               Caution
               +--------------------------------------+
               |Saving the master password on disk is |
               |extremely insecure and should be      |
               |avoided.                              |
               +--------------------------------------+

               Note
               +--------------------------------------+
               |If the --savemasterpassword option is |
               |not set, the master password file, if |
               |it exists, will be deleted.           |
               +--------------------------------------+
