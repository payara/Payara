start-domain(1)           asadmin Utility Subcommands          start-domain(1)

NAME
       start-domain - starts the DAS of the specified domain

SYNOPSIS
           start-domain [--help]
           [--debug={true|false}] [--domaindir domain-dir]
           [--dry-run={true|false}] [--upgrade={true|false}]
           [--verbose={true|false}] [--watchdog={true|false}]
           [--timeout timeout] [--warmup={true|false}] [domain-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The start-domain subcommand starts the domain administration server
       (DAS) of the specified domain. If a domain is not specified, the
       default domain is assumed. If the domains directory contains two or
       more domains, the domain-name operand must be specified.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           On the Windows platform,     |
           |           processes can bind to the    |
           |           same port. To avoid this     |
           |           problem, do not start        |
           |           multiple domains with the    |
           |           same port number at the same |
           |           time.                        |
           +----------------------------------------+

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           In Oracle GlassFish Server,  |
           |           the start-domain subcommand  |
           |           prompts for a new admin user |
           |           password if no password has  |
           |           been set for the admin user. |
           |           Additionally, the admin user |
           |           password must not be blank   |
           |           if secure administration is  |
           |           enabled; otherwise, the      |
           |           start-domain subcommand      |
           |           fails.                       |
           |           To provide the new admin     |
           |           user password, you can use   |
           |           the --passwordfile utility   |
           |           option of the asadmin(1M)    |
           |           command after adding the     |
           |           entry AS_ADMIN_NEWPASSWORD   |
           |           to the password file.        |

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --debug, -d
           Specifies whether the domain is started with Java Platform Debugger
           Architecture (JPDA)

           (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/jpda-141715.html)

           debugging enabled.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The instance is started with JPDA debugging enabled and the
               port number for JPDA debugging is displayed.

           false
               The instance is started with JPDA debugging disabled (default).

       --dry-run, -n
           Suppresses actual starting of the domain. Instead, start-domain
           displays the full java command that would be used to start the
           domain, including all options. Reviewing this command can be useful
           to confirm JVM options and when troubleshooting startup issues.

           The default value is false.

       --domaindir
           The domain root directory, which contains the directory of the
           domain that is to be restarted. If specified, the path must be
           accessible in the file system. The default location of the domain
           root directory is as-install/domains.

       --upgrade
           Specifies whether the configuration of the domain administration
           server (DAS) is upgraded to the current release. Normally, if the
           subcommand detects that the configuration is from an older release
           of GlassFish Server, the configuration is upgraded automatically
           before being started. You should not need to use this option
           explicitly.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               When the domain is started, the configuration is modified to be
               compatible with this release of GlassFish Server, and the
               GlassFish Server process stops.

           false
               The configuration of the DAS is not updated (default).

       --verbose, -v
           Specifies whether detailed information about the domain is
           displayed in the console window where the subcommand is run.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               Detailed startup messages and log messages about the domain are
               displayed in the console window where the subcommand is run. If
               the domain is later restarted by running the restart-domain(1)
               subcommand from a different console window, messages continue
               to be displayed in the original console window.

               You can kill the GlassFish Server process by typing CTRL-C in
               the console window.

               You can kill the GlassFish Server process and obtain a thread
               dump for the server by typing one of the following key
               combinations in the console window:

               *   CTRL-\ on UNIX systems

               *   CTRL-Break on Windows systems

           false
               Detailed information is not displayed (default).

       --watchdog, -w
           Specifies whether limited information about the domain is displayed
           in the console window where the subcommand is run. The --watchdog
           option is similar to --verbose but does not display the detailed
           startup messages and log messages. This option is useful when
           running the asadmin utility in the background or with no attached
           console.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               Limited information is displayed in the console window.

           false
               Limited information is not displayed in the console window
               (default).

       --timeout
           Specifies the amount of time in seconds the command will run for
           before timing out. Default is 600 seconds.

       --warmup
            Exit the server immediately after configuration is done. By default this is set as false.

OPERANDS
       domain-name
           The unique name of the domain you want to start.

           This operand is optional if only one domain exists in the GlassFish
           Server installation.

EXAMPLES

               Command start-domain executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           subcommand executed successfully

       1
