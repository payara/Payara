       services

SYNOPSIS
           monitor [--help]
           --type type
           [--filename filename]

           [--filter filter]
           instance-name

DESCRIPTION
       The monitor subcommand displays statistics for commonly monitored
       GlassFish Server components and services. The --type option must be
       used to specify the object for which statistics are to be displayed.
       Data is displayed continuously in a tabular form, or the data can be
       displayed at a particular time interval by using the --interval option.

       Before a given component or service can be monitored, monitoring must
       be enabled (set to HIGH or LOW) for the component or service by using
       the Administration Console, the enable-monitoring subcommand, or the
       set subcommand.

       The monitor subcommand has options for filtering the results and
       capturing the output in a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file. The output
       appears in a table format. To view the legend of the table header, type
       h.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --type
