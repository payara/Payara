restart-domain(1)         asadmin Utility Subcommands        restart-domain(1)

NAME
       restart-domain - restarts the DAS of the specified domain

SYNOPSIS
           restart-domain [--help] [--debug ={true|false}]
           [--domaindir domaindir]
           [--force={true|false}] [--kill={false|true}]
           [--timeout timeout] [domain-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The restart-domain subcommand stops and then restarts the domain
       administration server (DAS) of the specified domain. If a domain is not
       specified, the default domain is assumed. If the domains directory
       contains two or more domains, the domain-name operand must be
       specified. If the DAS is not already running, the subcommand attempts
       to start it.

       The restart-domain subcommand does not exit until the subcommand has
       verified that the domain has been stopped and restarted.

       This subcommand is supported in local or remote mode. If you specify a
       host name, the subcommand assumes you are operating in remote mode,
       which means you must correctly authenticate to the remote server. In
       local mode, you normally do not need to authenticate to the server as
       long as you are running the subcommand as the same user who started the
       server.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --debug
           Specifies whether the domain is restarted with Java Platform
           Debugger Architecture (JPDA)

           (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/jpda-141715.html)

           debugging enabled.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The domain is restarted with JPDA debugging enabled and the
               port number for JPDA debugging is displayed.

           false
               The domain is restarted with JPDA debugging disabled (default).

           The default is the current setting of this option for the domain
           that is being restarted.

       --domaindir
           The domain root directory, which contains the directory of the
           domain that is to be restarted. If specified, the path must be
           accessible in the file system. The default location of the domain
           root directory is as-install/domains.

       --force
           Specifies whether the domain is forcibly stopped immediately before
           it is restarted.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The domain is forcibly stopped immediately (default).

           false
               The subcommand waits until all threads that are associated with
               the domain are exited before stopping the domain.

       --kill
           Specifies whether the domain is killed before it is restarted by
           using functionality of the operating system to terminate the domain
           process.

           Possible values are as follows:

           false
               The domain is not killed. The subcommand uses functionality of
               the Java platform to terminate the domain process (default).

           true
               The domain is killed. The subcommand uses functionality of the
               operating system to terminate the domain process.

       --timeout
           Specifies the amount of time in seconds the command will run for
           before timing out. Default is 600 seconds.

OPERANDS
       domain-name
           The name of the domain you want to restart. Default is the name
           specified during installation, usually domain1.
