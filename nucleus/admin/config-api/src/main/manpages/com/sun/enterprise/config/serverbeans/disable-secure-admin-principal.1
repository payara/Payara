disable-secure-admin-principal(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands  disable-secure-admin-principal(1)

NAME
       disable-secure-admin-principal - disables the certificate for
       authorizing access in secure administration.

SYNOPSIS
           disable-secure-admin-principal
           [--help]
           --alias aliasname | DN

DESCRIPTION
       The disable-secure-admin-principal subcommand disables the certificate
       as being valid for authorizing access as part of secure administration.

       You must specify either the --alias option, or the DN.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --alias
           The alias name of the certificate in the truststore. GlassFish
           Server looks up the certificate in the truststore using that alias
           and, if found, disables the corresponding DN as being valid for
           secure administration. Because alias-name must be an alias
           associated with a certificate currently in the truststore, you may
           find it most useful for self-signed certificates.

OPERANDS
       DN
           The distinguished name of the certificate, specified as a
           comma-separated list in quotes. For example,
           "CN=system.amer.oracle.com,OU=GlassFish,O=Oracle
           Corporation,L=Santa Clara,ST=California,C=US" .
