create-http-lb-config(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands  create-http-lb-config(1)

NAME
       create-http-lb-config - creates a configuration for the load balancer

SYNOPSIS
           create-http-lb-config [--help] [--responsetimeout 60]
            [httpsrouting=false] [--reloadinterval 60]
            [--monitor=false] [--property (name=value)[:name=value]*]
            --target target | config_name

DESCRIPTION
       Use the create-http-lb-config subcommand to create a load balancer
       configuration. This configuration applies to load balancing in the HTTP
       path. After using this subcommand to create the load balancer
       configuration file, create the load balancer by running create-http-lb.

       You must specify either a target or a configuration name, or both. If
       you do not specify a target, the configuration is created without a
       target and you add one later using create-http-lb-ref. If you don't
       specify a configuration name, a name is created based on the target
       name. If you specify both, the configuration is created with the
       specified name, referencing the specified target.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --responsetimeout
           The time in seconds within which a server instance must return a
           response. If no response is received within the time period, the
           server is considered unhealthy. If set to a positive number, and
           the request is idempotent, the request is retried. If the request
           is not idempotent, an error page is returned. If set to 0 no
           timeout is used. The default is 60.

       --httpsrouting
           If set to true, HTTPS requests to the load balancer result in HTTPS
           requests to the server instance. If set to false, HTTPS requests to
           the load balancer result in HTTP requests to the server instance.
           The default is false.

       --reloadinterval
           The interval between checks for changes to the load balancer
           configuration file loadbalancer.xml. When the check detects
           changes, the configuration file is reloaded. A value of 0 disables
           reloading.

       --monitor
           Specifies whether monitoring is enabled. The default is false.

       --routecookie
           This option is deprecated. The value is always true.

       --property
           Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the load
           balancer.

       --target
           Specifies the target to which the load balancer configuration
           applies. If you don't specify a target, the load balancer
           configuration is created without a target. You can specify targets
           later using the subcommand create-http-lb-ref.

           Valid values are:

           *   stand-alone_instance_name- Specifies that requests for this
               standalone instance will be handled by the load balancer.

OPERANDS
       config_name
           The name of the new load balancer configuration. This name must not
           conflict with any other load balancer groups, agents,
           configurations, or sever instances in the domain. If you
           don't specify a name, the load balancer configuration name is based
           on the target name, target_name-http-lb-config.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating a Load Balancer Configuration
           This example creates a load balancer configuration on a target
           named mycluster and load balancer configuration named
           mylbconfigname.

               asadmin> create-http-lb-config --target mycluster mylbconfigname

               Command create-http-lb-config executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           subcommand executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the subcommand
