NAME
       delete-cluster - deletes a GlassFish Server cluster

SYNOPSIS
           delete-cluster [--help]
           cluster-name

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-cluster subcommand deletes a GlassFish Server cluster. A
       cluster can be deleted only if the cluster contains no GlassFish Server
       instances. If a cluster that you are deleting contains any instances,
       stop and delete the instances before deleting the cluster.

       If the cluster's named configuration was created automatically for the
       cluster and no other clusters or unclustered instances refer to the
       configuration, the configuration is deleted when the cluster is
       deleted. A configuration that is created automatically for a cluster is
       named cluster-name-config, where cluster-name is the name of the
       cluster.

       This command is supported in remote mode only.
