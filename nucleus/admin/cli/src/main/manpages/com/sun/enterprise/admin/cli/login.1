NAME
       login - logs you into a domain

SYNOPSIS
           login [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       The purpose of the login subcommand is to ease domain administration by
       letting you log into a particular domain. If GlassFish Server domains
       are created on various machines (locally), you can run the asadmin
       utility from any of these machines and manage domains located elsewhere
       (remotely). This is especially useful when a particular machine is
       chosen as an administration client that manages multiple domains and
       servers.

       The login subcommand prompts you for the administrator user name and
       password. After successful login, the .asadminpass file is created in
       your home directory. (This is the same file that is modified when you
       run the create-domain subcommand with the --savelogin option.) The
       literal host name is stored, and no resolution with the DNS is
       attempted. If a domain is being administered from other machines, it is
       sufficient to run the login subcommand once. You do not need to specify
       the asadmin utility options --user and --passwordfile when you run
       additional remote subcommands on that domain. After you have logged
       into a domain, you still need to provide the host and port for any
       subsequent remote subcommands unless you chose the default values for
       --host (localhost) and --port (4848) options.

       Subsequent use of same subcommand with the same parameters will result
       in overwriting the contents of the .asadminpass file for the given
       administration host and port. You can decide to overwrite the file or
       to reject such a login.

       Login information is saved permanently and can be used across multiple
       domain restarts.

       There is no logout subcommand. If you want to log in to another domain,
       run the login subcommand and specify new values for the asadmin utility
       options --host and --port.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Logging Into a Domain on a Remote Machine
           This example logs into a domain located on another machine. Options
           are specified before the login subcommand.

               asadmin --host foo --port 8282 login
               Please enter the admin user name>admin
               Please enter the admin password>

               Trying to authenticate for administration of server at host [foo]
               and port [8282] ...
               Login information relevant to admin user name [admin] for host [foo]
               and admin port [8282] stored at [/.asadminpass] successfully.
               Make sure that this file remains protected. Information stored in this
               file will be used by asadmin commands to manage associated domain.

       Example 2, Logging Into a Domain on the Default Port of Localhost
           This example logs into a domain on mylhost on the default port.
           Options are specified before the login subcommand.

               asadmin --host myhost login
               Please enter the admin user name>admin
               Please enter the admin password>
               Trying to authenticate for administration of server
               at host [myhost] and port [4848] ...
               An entry for login exists for host [myhost] and port [4848], probably
               from an earlier login operation.
               Do you want to overwrite this entry (y/n)?y
               Login information relevant to admin user name [admin] for host [myhost]
               and admin port [4848] stored at [/home/joe/.asadminpass] successfully.
               Make sure that this file remains protected. Information stored in this
               file will be used by asadmin commands to manage associated domain.
