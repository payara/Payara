multimode(1)              asadmin Utility Subcommands             multimode(1)

NAME
       multimode - allows multiple subcommands to be run while preserving
       environment settings and remaining in the asadmin utility

SYNOPSIS
           multimode [--help] [--file filename]
           [--printprompt={true|false}] [--encoding encode]

DESCRIPTION
       The multimode subcommand processes asadmin subcommands sequentially in
       a single session. The command-line interface prompts for a subcommand,
       runs that subcommand, displays the results of that subcommand, and then
       prompts for the next subcommand. All the asadmin options set in
       multimode apply to subsequent commands until the multimode session is
       exited. You exit multimode by typing exit, quit, or Ctrl-D.

       You can use the export subcommand to set your environment, or use the
       unset subcommand to remove environment variables from the multimode
       environment.

       You can also provide subcommands by passing a previously prepared list
       of subcommands from a file or standard input (pipe). When you use a
       file, you can include comment lines in the file by entering the hash
       symbol (#) as the first character of the line.

       You can invoke multimode from within a multimode session. When you exit
       the second multimode environment, you return to your original multimode
       environment.

       All the remote asadmin utility options can be supplied when invoking
       the multimode subcommand. The settings will apply as defaults for all
       subcommands that are run within the multimode session. For a list of
       the asadmin utility options, see the asadmin(1M) help page.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --file, -f
           Reads the subcommands in the specified file.

       --printprompt
           Controls printing of the asadmin prompt. By default, this option is
           set to the same value as the --interactive asadmin utility option.
           Normally you will not need to specify this option. Default is true.

       --encoding
           Specifies the character set for the file to be decoded. By default,
           the system character set is used.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Starting a Multimode Session
           This example starts a multimode session where: % is the system
           prompt.

               % asadmin multimode
               asadmin>
           You can also start a multimode session by typing asadmin without
           options or subcommands at the system prompt.

       Example 2, Running Multiple Commands From a File
           This example runs a sequence of subcommands from the
           commands_file.txt file.

               % asadmin multimode --file commands_file.txt

EXIT STATUS
       0
           subcommand executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the subcommand
