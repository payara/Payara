unset(1)                  asadmin Utility Subcommands                 unset(1)

NAME
       unset - removes one or more variables from the multimode environment

SYNOPSIS
           unset [--help] variable-list

DESCRIPTION
       The unset subcommand removes one or more environment variables that are
       set for the multimode environment. After removal, the variables and
       their associated values no longer apply to the multimode environment.

       To list the environment variables that are set, use the export
       subcommand without options. If the export subcommand lists no
       environment variables, no environment variables are set.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

OPERANDS
       variable-list
           A space-separated list of the environment variables to remove.

EXAMPLES

               AS_ADMIN_PORT = 8000
