export(1)                 asadmin Utility Subcommands                export(1)

NAME
       export - marks a variable name for automatic export to the environment
       of subsequent commands in multimode

SYNOPSIS
           export [--help] [variable-name=value [variable-name=value]*]

DESCRIPTION
       In multimode, the export subcommand marks an environment variable for
       automatic export to the environment of subsequent commands. All
       subsequent commands use the variable name value as specified unless you
       exit multimode, or use the unset subcommand to unset the variable. If
       only the variable name is specified, the current value of that variable
       name is displayed.

       If the export subcommand is used without any arguments, a list of all
       the exported variables and their values is displayed. Exported shell
       environment variables set prior to invoking the asadmin utility are
       imported automatically and set as exported variables within asadmin.
       Environment variables that are not exported cannot be read by the
       asadmin utility.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

OPERANDS
       variable-name=value
           Variable name and value for automatic export to the environment to
           be used by subsequent commands.
