NAME
       version - displays version information forGlassFish Server

SYNOPSIS
           version [--help] [--verbose={false|true}]
           [--local={false|true}]

DESCRIPTION
       The version subcommand displays version information for GlassFish
       Server. By default, if the subcommand cannot contact the domain
       administration server (DAS), the subcommand retrieves the version
       information locally and displays a warning message.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode and local mode.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --verbose, -v
           If this option is set to true, the subcommand provides the version
           of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that the server is running.
           The default is false.

       --local
           If this option is set to true, the subcommand obtains the version
           locally from the installation of GlassFish Server on the host where
           the subcommand is run.

           If this option is set to false (default), the subcommand attempts
           to contact the DAS to obtain the version. If the attempt to contact
           the DAS fails, the subcommand retrieves the version locally and
           displays a warning message.
