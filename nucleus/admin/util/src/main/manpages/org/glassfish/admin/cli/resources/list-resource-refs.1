       list-resource-refs - lists existing resource references

           list-resource-refs [--help] [target]

DESCRIPTION
       The list-resource-refs subcommand lists all resource references in a
       cluster or an unclustered server instance. This effectively lists all
       the resources (for example, JDBC resources) available in the JNDI tree
       of the specified target.

       The target instance or instances in the cluster need not be running or
       available for this subcommand to succeed.
