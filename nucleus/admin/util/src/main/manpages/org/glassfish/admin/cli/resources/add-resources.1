add-resources(1)          asadmin Utility Subcommands         add-resources(1)

NAME
       add-resources - creates the resources specified in an XML file

SYNOPSIS
           add-resources [--help] [--target target]
           [--upload={false|true}] xml-file-name

DESCRIPTION
       The add-resources subcommand creates the resources named in the
       specified XML file. The resources that can be created with this
       subcommand are listed in See Also in this help page.

       The --target option specifies the target for which you are creating the
       resources. If this option specifies the domain, the resources are added
       only to the configuration of the domain administration server (DAS). If
       this option specifies any other target, the resources are added to the
       configuration of the DAS and references are added to the resources from
       the specified target.

       The xml-file-name operand is the path to the XML file that contains the
       resources to be created. The DOCTYPE must be specified as
       http://glassfish.org/dtds/glassfish-resources_1_5.dtd in the
       resources.xml file.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which you are creating the resources.

           Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Creates the resources for the default server instance server
               and is the default value.

           domain
               Creates the resources for the domain.

           instance-name
               Creates the resources for a particular GlassFish Server
               instance.

       --upload
           Specifies whether the subcommand uploads the file to the DAS. In
           most situations, this option can be omitted.

           Valid values are as follows:

           false
               The subcommand does not upload the file and attempts to access
               the file through the specified file name. If the DAS cannot
               access the file, the subcommand fails.

               For example, the DAS might be running as a different user than
               the administration user and does not have read access to the
               file. In this situation, the subcommand fails if the --upload
               option is false.

           true
               The subcommand uploads the file to the DAS over the network
               connection.

           The default value depends on whether the DAS is on the host where
           the subcommand is run or is on a remote host.

           *   If the DAS is on the host where the subcommand is run, the
               default is false.

           *   If the DAS is on a remote host, the default is true.

OPERANDS
       xml-file-name
           The path to the XML file that contains the resources that are to be
           created. You can specify an absolute path, only the file name, or a
           relative path.

           *   If you specify an absolute path, the XML file can be anywhere.

           *   If you specify only the file name, the XML file must reside in
               the domain-dir/config directory on the DAS host. This
               requirement must be met even if you run the subcommand from
               another host.

           *   If you specify a relative path, the XML file must be in the
               relative directory.

           An example XML file follows.

               <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
