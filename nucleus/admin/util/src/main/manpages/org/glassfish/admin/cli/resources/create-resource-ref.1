create-resource-ref(1)    asadmin Utility Subcommands   create-resource-ref(1)

NAME
       create-resource-ref - creates a reference to a resource

SYNOPSIS
           create-resource-ref [--help] [--target target]
           [--enabled={false|true}] reference_name

DESCRIPTION
       The create-resource-ref subcommand creates a reference from a cluster
       or an unclustered server instance to a previously created resource, for
       example, a JDBC resource created by using the create-jdbc-resource
       subcommand. This effectively results in the resource being made
       available in the JNDI tree of the instance or cluster.

       The target instance or instances making up the cluster need not be
       running or available for this subcommand to succeed. If one or more
       instances are not available, they will receive the new resource the
       next time they start.

           Note
           +----------------------------------------+
           |           A resource-ref can only be   |
           |           created for bindable         |
           |           resources, such as a         |
           |           jdbc-resource,               |
           |           connector-resource,          |
           |           admin-object-resource,       |
           |           mail-resource,               |
           |           custom-resource, or          |
           |           jndi-resource.               |
           |           A jdbc-connection-pool or a  |
           |           connector-connection-pool    |
           |           are not referred to directly |
           |           by applications. Instead,    |
           |           they are referred to through |
           |           a jdbc-resource or           |
           |           connector-resource,          |
           |           respectively.                |

           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which you are creating the resource
           reference. Valid targets are as follows:

           server
               Creates the resource reference for the default server instance.
               This is the default target.

           deployment_group
               Creates the resource reference for every server instance in the
               deployment group.

           instance_name
               Creates the resource reference for the named unclustered server
               instance.

       --enabled
           Indicates whether the resource should be enabled. This value will
           take effect only if the resource is enabled at the global level.
           The default is true.

OPERANDS
       reference_name
           The name or JNDI name of the resource.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating a Reference to a JMS Destination Resource

               asadmin> create-resource-ref --target Cluster1 jms/Topic
