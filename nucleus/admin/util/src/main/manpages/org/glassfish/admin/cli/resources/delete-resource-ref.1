delete-resource-ref(1)    asadmin Utility Subcommands   delete-resource-ref(1)

NAME
       delete-resource-ref - removes a reference to a resource

SYNOPSIS
           delete-resource-ref [--help] [--target target] reference_name

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-resource-ref subcommand removes from a cluster or an
       unclustered server instance a reference to a resource (for example, a
       JDBC resource). This effectively results in the removal of the resource
       from the JNDI tree of the targeted instance or cluster.

       The target instance or instances making up the cluster need not be
       running or available for this subcommand to succeed. If one or more
       instances are not available, they will no longer load the resource in
       the JNDI tree the next time they start.

       Removal of the reference does not result in removal of the resource
       from the domain. The resource is removed only by the delete subcommand
       for that resource (for example, delete-jdbc-resource).

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

       --target
           Specifies the target from which you are removing the resource
           reference. Valid values are

               server and is the default value.

           deployment_group
               Removes the resource reference from every server instance in
               the deployment group.

           instance_name
               Removes the resource reference from the named unclustered
               server instance.
