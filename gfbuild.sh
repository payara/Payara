  GlassFish build wrapper script.
  Verifies that a suitable mvn version (>= 3.0.3) is available in the PATH.
  Also verifies that JDK 1.7 is installed to compile GlassFish.
  
  -r or -Dmaven.local.repo can be specified to supply the local maven repository location,
  otherwise the default is used, which is user's home directory (~/.m2/repository).
  The supplied directory will be created if needed.
  
  The script saves the output in gfbuild.log.

  -r LOCAL_REPO_PATH
                    path to a directory that will be used as a local maven
                    repository.
  -U
                    forces update of SNAPSHOTs

  MAVEN_PHASE
                    can be Maven phase, e.g.
                    clean
                    compile
                    package
